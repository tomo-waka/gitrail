# Output Schema & File Format Design

## Purpose

This document explains the output format, field semantics, and serialization logic in the current implementation.

Normative rules remain in `.github/instructions/schema.instructions.md`.

## File format overview

- One JSON object per line (JSON Lines / JSONL)
- Line endings: `\n` (LF only — never `\r\n`)
- File extension: `.jsonl`
- Encoding: UTF-8

## Output file naming

Files are named `{prefix}-{seq}.jsonl` where `seq` is a zero-padded 6-digit sequence number starting at `000001`.

Example sequence for prefix `my-repo`:

```
my-repo-000001.jsonl
my-repo-000002.jsonl
my-repo-000003.jsonl
```

Prefix derivation (in priority order):

1. `--output-prefix` if explicitly provided
2. Last path segment of remote origin URL, with `.git` suffix stripped
3. Directory name of `<repository-path>` if no remote origin is configured

## Record schema

Each line is a serialized `OutputCommit` object:

```typescript
interface OutputCommit {
  oid: string;
  subject: string;
  body: string;
  author: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    timestamp: string; // ISO 8601
  };
  committer: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    timestamp: string; // ISO 8601
  };
  parents: string[];
  repository: {
    name: string;
    url: string | null;
  };
}
```

## Field definitions

### `oid`

Full 40-character SHA-1 commit hash. Sourced directly from the Git object database.

### `subject` and `body`

Split from the raw commit message:

- `subject`: first line of the message
- `body`: remaining lines after the first, joined with `\n` and trimmed. Empty string `""` if no body exists.

Example with subject and body:

```
Fix null pointer in auth module\n\nDetailed explanation.\n\nCloses #123
```

Produces:

```json
{
  "subject": "Fix null pointer in auth module",
  "body": "Detailed explanation.\n\nCloses #123"
}
```

Example with subject only:

```
Bump version to 1.2.0
```

Produces:

```json
{
  "subject": "Bump version to 1.2.0",
  "body": ""
}
```

### `author` and `committer`

Both follow the same structure: `name`, `email`, and `timestamp`.

The difference between `author` and `committer`:

- `author` is the person who originally wrote the change.
- `committer` is the person who applied the commit to the repository. For ordinary commits these are the same. For cherry-picks, patches applied by a maintainer, or rebases, they can differ.

### `author.timestamp` / `committer.timestamp`

ISO 8601 string built from the timezone offset embedded in the commit object, not the system timezone. This ensures timestamps faithfully reproduce the developer's local time even when extracted on a machine in a different timezone.

Conversion logic:

isomorphic-git exposes two raw values per person:

| Field            | Type                          | Example (JST)                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `timestamp`      | Unix seconds                  | `1705312800`                  |
| `timezoneOffset` | Minutes from UTC, **negated** | `-540` (represents UTC+09:00) |

The negation is a quirk of isomorphic-git: JST (UTC+9) is stored as `-540`, not `+540`. The conversion function reverses this before building the offset string:

```
offsetMinutes = -timezoneOffset           // -(-540) = +540
offsetStr      = "+09:00"                 // 540 / 60 = 9 hours
localMs        = (timestamp + offsetMinutes * 60) * 1000
```

Worked example for `timestamp = 1705312800`, `timezoneOffset = -540` (JST):

```
offsetMinutes = 540
offsetStr     = "+09:00"
localMs       = (1705312800 + 540 * 60) * 1000
              = 1705345200000
UTC date      = 2024-01-15T18:00:00Z
Local date    = 2024-01-16T03:00:00+09:00  ← final output
```

### `parents`

Array of parent commit hashes:

| Commit type     | `parents` length | Example                |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Root commit     | `0`              | `[]`                   |
| Ordinary commit | `1`              | `["abc123"]`           |
| Merge commit    | `2`              | `["abc123", "def456"]` |

### `repository`

Carries repository metadata embedded in every record to make each line self-contained for downstream ingestion.

| Field  | Source                                                                                              |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name` | Derived from remote origin URL (last path segment, `.git` stripped), or directory name if no remote |
| `url`  | Remote origin URL as-is, or `null` if not configured                                                |

{
  "oid": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2",
  "subject": "Fix null pointer in auth module",
  "body": "Detailed explanation of the fix.\n\nCloses #123",
  "author": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T09:00:00+09:00"
  },
  "committer": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T09:05:00+09:00"
  },
  "parents": ["b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3"],
  "repository": {
    "name": "my-repo",
    "url": "https://github.com/org/my-repo"
  }
}
```

## File rotation

Rotation splits output across multiple numbered files rather than producing one unbounded file.

Thresholds (both optional, can be combined):

| Option             | Trigger condition                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--rotate-lines N` | After writing the Nth line, the next record opens a new file     |
| `--rotate-size N`  | After the file reaches N bytes, the next record opens a new file |

When both are configured, rotation triggers when **either** threshold is reached.

Rotation check happens **after** each write. The threshold is not crossed mid-record.

Byte counting: uses `Buffer.byteLength(line, "utf8")` — counts encoded bytes, not character count. This matters for multibyte Unicode content.

## Ordering note

JSONL line order reflects BFS traversal order across the Git DAG, not chronological commit order. Downstream consumers that need chronological ordering must sort by `committer.timestamp`.
