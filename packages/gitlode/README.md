# gitlode

> Extract Git commit history as JSON Lines — ready for warehouses, dashboards, and metrics pipelines.

**gitlode** is an ETL bridge between Git repositories and analytical systems. It reads a local Git
repository and emits one commit per line as [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) (`.jsonl`), so
downstream systems can ingest commit history without understanding Git internals.

gitlode is a faithful extractor: it maps Git object data as stored and leaves interpretation,
aggregation, and reporting to your downstream tools.

Named after the mining term lode (a vein of valuable ore), with a nod to load — gitlode (not gitload).

## Use cases

- **Continuous ingestion into a warehouse** — periodically fetch your repository and load only new
  commits into BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, DuckDB, or similar via incremental mode.
- **Developer activity dashboards** — measure commit frequency, contributor growth, and team
  velocity over time.
- **Release and change-velocity metrics** — track commit cadence, time-between-releases, and
  change volume per area of the codebase.
- **Cross-repository aggregation** — run gitlode across many repositories and stack the JSONL
  output into a single unified dataset.
- **Ad-hoc analysis with DuckDB or pandas** — extract once and query the `.jsonl` directly with
  `duckdb.read_json()` or `pandas.read_json(..., lines=True)`.

> gitlode is **not** for interactive history inspection — questions like "who changed this line?"
> or "what commits touched this file?" are better answered by a Git client or IDE. gitlode targets
> bulk extraction into analytical systems.

## Features

- Reads the local `.git` directory directly via [isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org/) — no `git` CLI required at runtime
- Outputs one record per line in JSON Lines format (commit-granularity by default)
- Two extraction modes: snapshot (full extraction each run) and `--incremental` (differential extraction using a state file)
- Handles multi-branch extraction with cross-branch deduplication

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 22.0.0
- A local Git repository (cloned and fetched via your preferred method — gitlode reads `.git` data directly and does not require the `git` CLI)

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g gitlode
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-time extraction from a local clone
gitlode -r main ./my-repo

# Continuous extraction — fetch remote changes, then extract new commits
git -C ./my-repo fetch origin
gitlode --incremental -r origin/main -s ./gitlode-state.json --missing-state snapshot ./my-repo
```

See the [User Guide](docs/usage.md) for detailed workflow patterns including incremental setup,
release-tag-based extraction, and CI configuration.

## CLI Reference

```bash
gitlode [options] <repository-path>

Progress, summary, and profile output are written to **stderr**; use `--quiet` to suppress them.
Validation errors exit with code `1`; runtime errors with code `2`. See the
[User Guide](docs/usage.md#cli-reference) for the full list of mutual exclusion rules.

## Output

In the default commit-granularity mode, each line in the output `.jsonl` file is a JSON object representing one commit. With `--per-file`, each line represents one changed file within a commit, with full commit metadata denormalized onto each record plus a `file` object containing `path`, `status`, `additions`, and `deletions`.

Commit-mode record example:

```json
{
  "oid": "a1b2c3d4...",
  "subject": "Fix null pointer in auth module",
  "body": "",
  "author": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T09:00:00+09:00"
  },
  "committer": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T09:05:00+09:00"
  },
  "parents": ["parenthash1"],
  "repository": { "name": "my-repo", "url": "https://github.com/org/my-repo" }
}
```

| `parents`                                  | Array of parent commit OIDs (empty for the initial commit; two entries for merge commits) |
| `repository.name`                          | Repository name derived from remote origin URL (falls back to directory name)             |
| `repository.url`                           | Remote origin URL, or `null` if no remote is configured                                   |

Current runtime support is limited to repositories using the `sha1` object format due to
`isomorphic-git` behavior in gitlode-used operations. Repositories with unsupported object
formats fail fast with:
`Unsupported repository object format: <format>. Supported formats: sha1.`

Output files are named `<prefix>-<timestamp>-000001.jsonl`, `<prefix>-<timestamp>-000002.jsonl`, and so on. The prefix is
derived from the repository's remote origin URL; use `--output-prefix` to override. The timestamp
segment (`YYYYMMDDTHHmmssZ`) is captured once per session, so all files from a single run share
the same timestamp and will not overwrite files produced by earlier runs. Use
`--rotate-lines` or `--rotate-size` to split output across multiple files.

> **Note:** Output line order is not guaranteed to be chronological. Sort by `committer.timestamp`
> in your downstream system.
