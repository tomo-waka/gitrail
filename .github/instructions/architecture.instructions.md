# Architecture & Component Design

## Layer Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│           CLI Layer             │  Argument parsing, validation, error display
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│         Core Logic Layer        │  Commit traversal orchestration, JSON mapping, state file management
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│      Git Adapter Interface      │  Abstract interface — isolates isomorphic-git dependency
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│    isomorphic-git (external)    │  Actual Git object access
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer must only depend on the layer directly below it. The Core Logic layer must never import from isomorphic-git directly.

## Product Context and Design Principles

These principles govern design decisions across all layers. When a new feature or change creates
ambiguity about where logic belongs or what behavior is correct, use these as the deciding criteria.

- **gitrail is a faithful extractor, not an analytics engine.** Map Git object data exactly as
  stored. Do not infer, derive, or add attributes beyond what the spec explicitly defines. Leave
  interpretation to downstream systems.
- **The correctness guarantee is:** every commit reachable from the specified refs, within the
  specified range, appears exactly once in a single run's output. Any change that could violate
  this guarantee requires explicit justification.
- **Snapshot and incremental are user intent signals, not shortcuts.** Both modes must produce
  correct subsets of the DAG. `snapshot` = extract independently of prior state; `incremental` =
  extract only commits new since the last recorded state. Neither mode may silently produce a
  superset or a subset of the intended range.
- **Git's data model constraints are not gitrail limitations.** Commits carry no branch field;
  output order is not chronological; branch refs are mutable. These properties must be respected
  and documented, not worked around with fragile heuristics.
- **Interpretation belongs downstream.** gitrail outputs what Git stores. Derived attributes
  (e.g. branch membership per commit, authorship statistics, release attribution) are not gitrail
  responsibilities and must not be added without a deliberate spec change.

## v0.4.0 Migration Contract

The v0.4.0 release introduces a phased architecture redesign from the current mixed-responsibility
`Extractor` flow to an explicit fact-based pipeline. During this migration, planning and
implementation sessions must treat the following contract as binding.

### Target end-state vocabulary

- `CommitFact` and `FileChangeFact` are the stable Core-owned terms for intermediate extraction data.
- `CheckpointStore`, `ExtractionCheckpoint`, and `BranchCheckpoint` are the stable Core-owned terms
  for checkpoint persistence contracts.
- `ExtractionCoordinator`, `CommitTraversalExtractor`, `FileChangeExpander`,
  `CommitRecordProjector`, `FileChangeRecordProjector`, and `OutputSink` are the target named stage
  boundaries for the redesigned pipeline.

### Migration boundary rules

- The redesign is phased. Do not collapse the migration into a single rewrite.
- `Extractor` remains the compatibility facade until the dedicated coordinator/orchestration phase
  explicitly replaces its mixed responsibilities.
- No phase may move checkpoint commit timing, sink lifecycle ownership, or progress ownership into a
  coordinator abstraction before that orchestration phase is reached.
- No phase may move file-granularity branching into dedicated expander/projector modules before the
  dedicated projector-split phase is reached.
- CLI-visible behavior, output schema semantics, and the current `ExtractionResult` shape must
  remain unchanged unless a later release phase explicitly redesigns those user-facing contracts.

### Ownership rules during migration

- Core owns the fact vocabulary, checkpoint vocabulary, traversal/extraction workflow, and the
  compatibility seams needed to preserve behavior while the pipeline is being split.
- The Git adapter continues to own Git-native raw commit/file-change data and repository access
  primitives; it must not be reshaped around the new fact vocabulary prematurely.
- The output layer continues to own `OutputRecord` serialization, rotation, and concrete file
  writing concerns.
- Domain-oriented stage boundaries are preferred over using `OutputRecord` as the final Core
  boundary. Projection remains distinct from traversal and from persistence in the target design.

### Phase 2 traversal-stage contract

- `CommitTraversalExtractor` is the first extracted stage boundary in the v0.4.0 migration.
- It owns branch-head resolution and collection, per-branch exclusion-boundary calculation,
  merge-base calculation for newly added branches, sequential branch traversal, cross-branch
  deduplication, `since-date` filtering, and `COMMIT_NOT_FOUND` fallback behavior.
- It consumes already-loaded checkpoint data from Core; it does not read or write
  `CheckpointStore` and it does not decide checkpoint commit timing.
- Its output contract is a traversal result containing `AsyncIterable<CommitFact>` plus a
  candidate `ExtractionCheckpoint` derived from the successfully resolved branch heads.
- `Extractor` remains responsible for repository/checkpoint loading, output projection,
  file-change expansion, output-writer lifecycle, progress ownership, and persisting the returned
  checkpoint only after successful output completion.

---

## Component Responsibilities

### CLI Layer (`src/cli/`)

- Parse and validate CLI arguments (see `cli.instructions.md` for full parameter spec)
- Enforce mutual-exclusion rules between parameters
- Instantiate Core and pass resolved config (including `stateFilePath` as a string — state file I/O is performed by Core, not CLI)
- Handle top-level errors and format user-facing error messages
- Exit with appropriate codes: `0` = success, `1` = user error, `2` = runtime error

### Core Logic Layer (`src/core/`)

Responsibilities:

- Orchestrate commit traversal by calling `GitAdapter`
- Map raw commit data to the output JSON schema
- Apply differential filtering (since-commit / since-date); uses `continue` (not `break`) for `--since-date` because BFS order is not chronological
- Read the state file at startup; write it atomically (`.tmp` → rename) only after all output files are fully flushed and closed
- Instantiate `OutputWriter` with the rotation config — rotation thresholds are enforced inside `OutputWriter`, not in Core

During the Phase 2 migration split, Core keeps checkpoint-store I/O, output projection,
file-change expansion, writer lifecycle, and progress timing in `Extractor`, while
`CommitTraversalExtractor` becomes the owning boundary for traversal mechanics and checkpoint
candidate composition.

Key types:

```typescript
type ExtractionRange = { type: "commit"; hash: string } | { type: "date"; since: Date };

interface ExtractorConfig {
  repositoryPath: string;
  branches: string[]; // At least one required
  outputDir: string;
  outputPrefix: string;
  rotation: RotationConfig;
  outputMode: "commit" | "file";
  range?: ExtractionRange;
  stateFilePath?: string;
}

interface RotationConfig {
  maxLines?: number;
  maxBytes?: number;
}
```

### Git Adapter Interface (`src/git/`)

The interface abstracts all Git operations. Core Logic must program against this interface only.

```typescript
interface GitAdapter {
  /** Resolve a ref (branch name) to a commit hash */
  resolveRef(repoPath: string, ref: string): Promise<string>;

  /** Walk commits reachable from `head`, stopping before `excludeHash` if provided.
   *  Commit order is not guaranteed — consumers must not rely on line order for
   *  chronological sorting. Each commit carries a `committer.timestamp` for that purpose. */
  walkCommits(repoPath: string, head: string, excludeHash?: string): AsyncIterable<RawCommit>;

  /** Return the remote URL for `origin`, or null if not set */
  getRemoteUrl(repoPath: string): Promise<string | null>;

  /** Return per-file change info between `commitOid` and `parentOid`.
   *  If `parentOid` is omitted (root commit), all files in the commit tree are "added".
   *  Binary files have `additions: null` and `deletions: null`. */
  getFileChanges(
    repoPath: string,
    commitOid: string,
    parentOid?: string,
  ): Promise<readonly FileChange[]>;

  /** Find the common ancestor (merge base) commit hash among all provided commit hashes.
   *  Returns null if no common ancestor exists (e.g. orphan branches). */
  findMergeBase(repoPath: string, commitHashes: string[]): Promise<string | null>;
}

interface RawCommit {
  oid: string;
  message: string;
  author: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    timestamp: number; // Unix seconds
    timezoneOffset: number; // minutes from UTC (e.g. +540 for JST)
  };
  committer: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    timestamp: number;
    timezoneOffset: number;
  };
  parents: string[];
}

interface FileChange {
  path: string;
  status: "added" | "modified" | "deleted";
  additions: number | null; // null for binary files
  deletions: number | null; // null for binary files
}
```

### isomorphic-git Adapter (`src/git/isomorphic-git-adapter.ts`)

The concrete implementation of `GitAdapter` using isomorphic-git.

- Uses `isomorphic-git`'s `readCommit()` (BFS traversal), `resolveRef()`, `getConfig()`, and `walk()` + `TREE()` (file diff) APIs
- Does **not** use isomorphic-git's `log()` API; BFS is implemented manually using `readCommit()` in a queue loop
- Implements commit exclusion via reachability pre-computation (see `git-traversal.instructions.md`)
- Must not leak isomorphic-git types outside this file
- Accepts an optional `FsClient` in its constructor for dependency injection (defaults to `node:fs`)

### Output Layer (`src/output/`)

- Serialize `OutputRecord` objects (`OutputCommit | OutputFileRecord`) to JSON Lines
- Track current file's line count and byte size
- Rotate to a new file when thresholds are exceeded
- Generate output filenames: `{prefix}-{timestamp}-{sequenceNumber padded to 6 digits}.jsonl`
- Use `\n` (LF) as line endings — never `\r\n`

---

## File Layout Convention

Every layer follows a consistent two-file pattern:

- **`types.ts`** — all TypeScript interfaces and type aliases for that layer. No runtime code.
- **`index.ts`** — re-export barrel only. No type definitions or logic.

This separation was introduced in Phase 2 to keep type definitions discoverable and to prevent circular imports between layers.

---

## State File

Managed by Core Logic. Written atomically (write to temp file, then rename).

Schema:

```typescript
interface StateFile {
  version: 1;
  generatedAt: string; // ISO 8601
  repositoryPath: string;
  branches: Array<{
    name: string;
    lastCommitHash: string;
  }>;
}
```

Rules:

- State file is written **only after all output files for that run are fully flushed and closed**
- If extraction fails mid-run, the previous state file must remain unchanged
- On next run, if a branch in the state file no longer exists in the repo, log a warning and skip that branch

---

## Error Handling Conventions

- All errors thrown from the Git Adapter must be wrapped in a `GitAdapterError` before propagating to Core
- User-facing errors (invalid args, missing repo, hash not found) must produce a clear single-line message without a stack trace
- Internal/unexpected errors should include the stack trace for debugging

### `GitAdapterError` Definition

```typescript
type GitAdapterErrorCode =
  | "REF_NOT_FOUND" // Specified branch/ref does not exist in the repository
  | "COMMIT_NOT_FOUND" // Specified commit hash does not exist or is not reachable
  | "NOT_A_REPOSITORY" // Target path is not a Git repository
  | "REMOTE_NOT_FOUND" // Remote origin is not configured (non-fatal; triggers fallback)
  | "UNKNOWN"; // Unexpected error from the underlying library

class GitAdapterError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public readonly code: GitAdapterErrorCode,
    public readonly cause?: unknown,
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "GitAdapterError";
  }
}
```

### Error Code Handling in Core Logic

Core Logic must inspect `code` to determine the appropriate response:

| Code               | Severity  | Core Behaviour                                               |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `REF_NOT_FOUND`    | Fatal     | Abort with user-facing error message                         |
| `COMMIT_NOT_FOUND` | Fatal     | Abort with user-facing error message                         |
| `NOT_A_REPOSITORY` | Fatal     | Abort with user-facing error message                         |
| `REMOTE_NOT_FOUND` | Non-fatal | Log a warning; fall back to directory name for output prefix |
| `UNKNOWN`          | Fatal     | Abort; include stack trace in output                         |
