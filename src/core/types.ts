/**
 * A named, accumulating timer that supports hierarchical scoping.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 * - `start()`: Resets wall/work durations to 0 and begins wall timing. No-op if already running.
 * - `resume()`: Begins accumulating without resetting. No-op if already running.
 * - `stop()`: Pauses accumulation. No-op if not running.
 * - `measureWork(fn)`: Measures one work interval and adds it to additive work time.
 * - `entries()`: Returns a snapshot of this profiler and all descendants in preorder.
 *   If called while running, includes elapsed time up to the current moment.
 *
 * ## Tree structure
 * Each profiler may have child profilers created via `createScopedProfiler()`.
 * Parent and child durations are completely independent: a parent's times are
 * determined solely by its own `start/resume/stop` calls, not by its children.
 * Siblings are ordered by creation order.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 * Sharing a single profiler instance across concurrent async operations is not
 * recommended. Unexpected interleaving of `resume/stop` calls may produce inaccurate
 * measurements, but will not throw exceptions or affect the main extraction process.
 * Wall-clock timing is reference-count based so overlapping intervals are counted once.
 * Additive work timing should be recorded via `measureWork(...)`.
 *
 * ## Error tolerance
 * All methods are designed to be safe to call in any order. Unexpected call sequences
 * (e.g., `stop()` when not running) are silently treated as no-ops.
