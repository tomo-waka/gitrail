# gitlode — v0.8.0 Release Plan

## Overview

v0.8.0 is a plugin-focused minor release. It expands plugin data-expression flexibility,
clarifies runtime/plugin responsibility boundaries, improves CLI orchestration testability,
and extends the configuration surface beyond plugin loading while preserving extraction
semantics.

## Release Goals

- Enable scalar-valued plugin extension outputs with clear contract boundaries.
- Establish consistent run-scoped runtime and plugin service-injection responsibilities.
- Improve main orchestration maintainability and behavioral test coverage without CLI behavior changes.
- Define the next configuration-file expansion path beyond plugin loading.

## Scope Summary

### Included in v0.8.0

- Architecture/CLI Runtime: Run-scoped responsibility boundaries and runtime service injection consistency
- Plugin Contract: Allow scalar values in extensions.<namespace>
- Architecture/CLI Runtime: main orchestration refactoring and unit-test expansion
- Configuration File: General-purpose configuration file beyond plugin loading

### Explicitly excluded from v0.8.0

- Release Engineering: Staged monorepo CI/CD evolution with changesets adoption
