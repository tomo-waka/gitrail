# gitrail — Feature Roadmap

This file records all planned improvements beyond the initial release: product features, CLI UX improvements, and development environment tasks.

Items are grouped by expected priority order within each section. Final ordering is subject to review.

This roadmap is intentionally organized by product priority and time horizon, not by release version. When an item is selected for a specific release, annotate it with lightweight metadata instead of moving it to a different section.

### Metadata Convention

Use the following field on selected items when needed:

- **Release target**: the intended version, such as `v0.1.4`

The intended document flow is:

- roadmap → future-facing backlog and release targeting
- plan → active implementation tracking
- changelog → released history

Execution status is intentionally not tracked in the roadmap for now. If that becomes necessary later, it should be redesigned based on an actual operational need rather than kept as a weak placeholder.

This keeps the roadmap stable for both humans and LLMs while still making release planning explicit.

## Product Improvements

### Near-term

#### Architecture: Fact-based extraction pipeline and orchestration split

**Release target**: `v0.4.0`

The current extraction flow centralizes too many responsibilities inside `Extractor`: commit
traversal, file-level expansion, output projection, sink lifecycle, and state checkpoint update.
This is acceptable as a PoC baseline, but it is not the desired pre-release architecture for a
tool that is expected to grow additional pipeline stages and heterogeneous output sinks.

This should be treated as an **architecture-level redesign item**, not as a local dependency
inversion cleanup. The goal is to separate domain-stage responsibilities and make the execution
workflow explicit, while preserving current CLI-visible behavior and output semantics during the
migration.

**Final target architecture decided from design discussion**:

- introduce an orchestration layer between CLI/runtime and the core extraction stages
- treat the internal checkpoint workflow as orchestration responsibility rather than extractor responsibility
- split the current extraction flow into the following named stages:
  - `ExtractionCoordinator`
  - `CommitTraversalExtractor`
  - `FileChangeExpander`
  - `CommitRecordProjector`
  - `FileChangeRecordProjector`
  - `OutputSink`
- use domain-oriented stage boundaries rather than `OutputRecord` as the final core boundary
- use `CommitFact` and `FileChangeFact` as the stable internal terms for stage-to-stage data
- use `CheckpointStore`, `ExtractionCheckpoint`, and `BranchCheckpoint` as the preferred internal terminology for checkpoint persistence

**Resulting pipeline shape**:

- commit-granularity pipeline: `ExtractionCoordinator -> CommitTraversalExtractor -> CommitRecordProjector -> OutputSink`
- file-granularity pipeline: `ExtractionCoordinator -> CommitTraversalExtractor -> FileChangeExpander -> FileChangeRecordProjector -> OutputSink`
- `RecordGranularity` is interpreted only by `ExtractionCoordinator`; other stages do not branch on output mode

**Stage responsibility contract**:

- `ExtractionCoordinator`: builds the pipeline, owns progress/reporting integration, closes the sink, and commits checkpoints only after successful sink completion
- `CommitTraversalExtractor`: performs branch traversal, differential range application, cross-branch deduplication, and branch-head collection, and emits `CommitFact`
- `FileChangeExpander`: derives `FileChangeFact` from `CommitFact` using Git-derived file change expansion policy
- `...RecordProjector`: converts facts into the current output schema; projection is separate from traversal and from persistence
- `OutputSink`: persists `OutputRecord` values and owns serialization, rotation, and sink metrics
- `CheckpointStore`: reads and writes checkpoints, but does not decide checkpoint timing

**Important invariants to preserve during redesign**:

- keep user-visible CLI input/output behavior unchanged during the migration
- preserve sequential branch traversal and non-interleaved branch output
- preserve cross-branch deduplication and current differential extraction semantics
- preserve `since-date` skip-and-continue behavior
- preserve `COMMIT_NOT_FOUND` fallback behavior
- keep zero-record runs from creating empty output files
- advance progress only after successful `OutputSink.write()`
- commit checkpoints only after successful `OutputSink.close()`
- preserve the current `ExtractionResult` shape until a separate design decision says otherwise

**Phased migration plan**:

- Phase 1: introduce the new vocabulary and abstractions while keeping `Extractor` as a compatibility facade
- Phase 2: extract `CommitTraversalExtractor` so commit traversal and checkpoint boundary calculation no longer depend on output persistence
- Phase 3: introduce `FileChangeExpander` and split projection into commit/file projectors so granularity branching moves out of traversal
- Phase 4: move sink lifecycle and checkpoint commit ordering into `ExtractionCoordinator`, with concrete Node.js wiring created at the runtime edge
- Phase 5: remove obsolete direct imports and remaining mixed-responsibility code paths once behavior is locked by tests

**Migration boundary guidance**:

- `AsyncIterable<OutputRecord>` remains the preferred first migration checkpoint because it enables safe producer/consumer separation without forcing the full final architecture in one step
- this intermediate boundary is not the final architectural target; the end-state should keep output-schema projection separate from fact production
- treat this work as a phased redesign to be completed across multiple implementation phases, not as a single big-bang rewrite

**Why this should happen before v1.0.0**:

- gitrail is still effectively a pre-release PoC, so this is the right stage to make structural corrections that would be much more expensive after the public interface and internal layering harden
- the resulting pipeline boundary is expected to make future items such as enrichment stages, stdout output, field filtering, and improved profiling easier to design without re-growing a monolithic extractor

#### CLI UX: Parameter model redesign for extraction and output grain

**Release target**: `v0.4.0`

The current CLI parameter system mixes multiple conceptual axes in a way that is technically
usable but not clean from a user-experience perspective. In particular, the combination of
`--mode snapshot|incremental`, `--output-mode commit|file`, and `--on-missing-state` exposes an
inconsistent parameter model: one axis is expressed as a generic `mode`, another as a prefixed
`output-mode`, and the fallback behavior is named relative to the current implementation rather
than the underlying extraction model.

This should be treated as a **UX-level design bug**, not as a cosmetic naming issue. The problem
is not limited to `--output-mode`; the full parameter system around extraction intent, output
grain, and missing-state fallback should be redesigned together.

**Decision taken from design discussion**:

- replace `--mode snapshot|incremental` with boolean `--incremental`
- replace `--output-mode commit|file` with boolean `--per-file`
- replace `--on-missing-state error|snapshot` with `--missing-state=error|snapshot`
- keep `snapshot` as an execution-model term in documentation and fallback semantics, but remove
  it as a top-level CLI value

**Resulting parameter model**:

- default behavior: snapshot extraction
- `--incremental`: extract only commits newer than the last recorded state
- `--state <path>`: required with `--incremental`; without `--incremental`, acts as a write-only
  recording path on successful snapshot extraction
- `--missing-state=error|snapshot`: valid only with `--incremental`
- `--per-file`: emit one record per changed file; without it, emit one record per commit

**Important design rationale**:

- `--incremental` expresses user intent directly and removes the overly abstract `mode` parameter
- snapshot remains an important concept in gitrail because it communicates independent extraction
  from a mutable DAG-backed repository state; this meaning should remain in docs and behavior even
  if it is no longer exposed as a CLI enum value
- the core output grain should be treated as `commit|file`; finer-grained interpretation should be
  handled later, if needed, through enrichment or pipeline extensions rather than by expanding the
  default CLI grain model
- `--missing-state=error|snapshot` is preferred over alternatives such as `ignore` or `full`
  because it names the actual fallback behavior precisely

**Detailed design expectations**:

- treat this parameter model as the baseline for the detailed design phase rather than reopening
  the high-level direction from scratch
- verify the mutual-exclusion rules and help text against the new model
- update all user-facing documentation together so the new terminology is introduced consistently
- design migration messaging appropriate for a pre-v1 CLI, where breaking changes are acceptable
  but should still be explicit

#### CLI UX: Release-boundary extraction workflow

The current gitrail CLI can express "extract commits after a given ref" via `--since-ref`, but it
does not provide an explicit, user-facing way to express the complementary release-oriented
workflow that naturally appears in repositories using release tags: snapshot the history included
in a release once, then continuously ingest only the post-release range as new commits accumulate.

This should not be treated as a simple request for the inverse of `--since-ref`. The user intent is
not "the complement of commits after X" but "the commit set included in release ref X" as a stable
extraction boundary. Conceptually, this is closer to treating a release ref as a traversal
starting point or boundary than to subtracting one reachability set from another.

**Target workflow**:

- history at or before the latest stable release is assumed to be stable and can be extracted once as a snapshot
- commits after that release continue to grow toward the next release
- therefore, the post-release range should be bootstrapped once via `--since-ref` and then maintained through daily incremental extraction with a state file

**Current workaround and its limitations**:

- in Git terms, users may be able to approximate "extract up to release X" by creating a temporary ref fixed at that release and passing it to `--branch`
- if `--branch <ref>` is treated as a true general ref traversal entry point, users may also be able to use the release tag itself directly rather than creating a temporary branch
- however, neither approach is an intuitive CLI expression of the user's intent, and both require the user to translate a release-boundary question into lower-level ref manipulation
- in addition, the ref-resolution behavior for lightweight tags, annotated tags, branch names, and raw commit hashes should be made explicit if release refs are to become part of the supported workflow model

This item should therefore be treated as a **UX and extraction-model design problem**, not merely
as a request for one additional flag.

**Questions to resolve at design time**:

- whether to add an explicit `--until-ref` style parameter, or instead make release-ref traversal a first-class documented workflow without introducing a new range flag
- whether this capability should be defined as "snapshot the history included in the specified ref" rather than as the complement of `--since-ref`
- how `--branch`, `--since-ref`, `--state`, and incremental bootstrap should fit together as one coherent release-boundary workflow
- how ref resolution should be specified for tag names, branch names, commit hashes, and annotated-tag peeling behavior
- whether this model should be limited to single-boundary release workflows, or whether a multi-branch interpretation is desirable and sufficiently clear

**Design priority**:

- users should be able to understand "extract up to the latest release once" and "bootstrap from the latest release, then switch to incremental" without having to reason in terms of temporary refs or Git-internal setup steps
- the resulting UX should form a conceptually paired explanation with the existing `--since-ref` + state-file workflow for post-release ingestion
- even if an internal workaround uses an auxiliary ref, that workaround should not become the primary user-facing workflow

#### CLI UX: Progress metrics quality and progress-display redesign

**Release target**: `v0.4.0`

The current Phase 2 implementation reports progress using the number of written commits (`Processed N commits...`). This is better than having no runtime visibility, and it remains acceptable for v0.1.4, but it is not always a good proxy for actual elapsed work.

For example, runs that use a state file and ultimately write zero new commits can still spend substantial time traversing history or resolving repository state. In those situations, commit-count progress has only a weak relationship to elapsed time and user-perceived progress.

**Future improvement goals**:

- break the end-to-end extraction work into more meaningful phases and measure their durations separately
- analyze where time is actually spent during traversal, filtering, state handling, and output writing
- redesign progress reporting based on that evidence rather than using commit count alone
- keep the current Phase 2 behavior in v0.1.4 as a pragmatic baseline, but treat it as a first iteration rather than a final UX design

**Design dependency**: This redesign should be approached together with the "Granular performance profiling" item (see Medium-term section). Progress display redesign requires knowing what is measurable; performance profiling provides that evidence. Design both together in the same release.

#### CLI UX: `--help` option grouping and discoverability

The `--help` output lists all options in a flat list with no grouping. The jump from "I want incremental extraction" to "I need `--state`" is non-obvious.

- Group options under section headers: **Output**, **Differential Extraction**, **File Rotation**
- Add a note to the `--state` description: "Primary mechanism for scheduled/incremental runs"
- Evaluate whether citty supports option grouping natively; if not, consider a custom help renderer

**Design resolution notes (v0.2.0 — deferred)**:

- citty does not support option grouping natively (confirmed at v0.2.0 design time). A custom help renderer would be required.
- Deferred on cost/value grounds: the option set (~10 options) is small enough to be readable without grouping, and gitrail usage patterns tend toward fixed, recurring invocations rather than exploratory CLI trial-and-error. The implementation cost of a custom renderer outweighs the discoverability benefit at this scale.
- `docs/usage.md` and README serve as the primary reference for workflow guidance in the interim.

#### CLI UX: `--rotate-size` human-readable size suffixes

`--rotate-size` currently accepts a raw byte count. In practice, users specify thresholds like 500 MB or 1 GB, making raw byte values impractical to type and error-prone to read.

Supporting suffixes such as `--rotate-size 500M` or `--rotate-size 1G` would align the option with the conventions used by popular CLI tools (e.g. GNU `split`, `logrotate`).

**Considerations to resolve at implementation time**:

- Which suffixes to accept (`K`, `M`, `G`; case-insensitive or not)
- Base convention: binary (1 K = 1024) vs. decimal (1 K = 1000) — survey popular CLI tools for the dominant convention at implementation time
- Whether to continue accepting a plain integer as a raw byte count for backward compatibility
- Error message wording for unrecognized suffix values

---

#### CLI UX: Warn on unknown CLI arguments

Currently, citty parses arguments with `strict: false` (inherited from `node:util.parseArgs`), which means unrecognized options are silently ignored. A typo such as `--rotate-line` (instead of `--rotate-lines`) passes through without any diagnostic, and the option simply has no effect. This is indistinguishable from a bug in the program itself.

Most mainstream CLI frameworks treat unknown arguments as an error or at minimum a warning (e.g. `argparse` exits with code 2, `commander` errors by default, `yargs` with `strict()` mode). The current behavior is inconsistent with user expectations and can be considered a usability defect.

**Reference behavior: git**:

git is the primary CLI reference for gitrail's UX standards. Although many users interact with git through IDEs or GUI clients rather than the terminal directly, gitrail operates on local git repositories — making git's own CLI conventions the most relevant baseline. When users do invoke gitrail manually, the mental model they bring is shaped by git's behavior.

git treats unknown options as fatal errors and exits immediately without performing any work:

```
$ git log --unknown-option
fatal: unrecognized argument: --unknown-option
# exit code: 128
```

This means the expected behavior for gitrail is also **error on unknown arguments, exit non-zero, perform no extraction**. A `console.warn`-and-continue approach (warn but proceed) is inconsistent with this baseline and should be considered a fallback only if implementation constraints prevent a clean error path.

**Fix directions to evaluate at design time**:

- **`setup()` hook approach**: In the `defineCommand` `setup()` hook, compare `rawArgs` against the set of known option names (including aliases and kebab/camelCase variants) and emit a `console.warn` to stderr for each unrecognized option. Low implementation cost; no dependency changes.
- **citty issue / upstream fix**: File a feature request upstream to expose a `strict` mode option. Monitor for resolution before implementing locally.
- **Library migration**: `commander` and `yargs` have built-in strict modes, but migrating away from citty is a larger architectural change and is not warranted for this issue alone.

**Design considerations**:

- Warnings should go to stderr so they are not captured by output redirection.
- `--quiet` suppresses progress and summary output but should **not** suppress unknown-argument warnings — a silent typo with `--quiet` would be the hardest failure mode to diagnose.
- Positional arguments and `--` passthrough must be excluded from the unknown-option check.
- The warning message should suggest the closest known option name (edit-distance heuristic) if feasible.

### Medium-term

#### Development: Granular performance profiling

**Release target**: `v0.4.0`
**Status**: Implemented in Phase 6.

Add per-phase timing instrumentation to measure where time is actually spent during extraction. The target granularity is: DAG traversal, blob reads, diff computation (per-file), and output writing.

**Motivation**: File-level output mode (`--output-mode file`, introduced in v0.3.0) computes a tree diff for every commit, which increases processing time proportionally to the number of changed files. If performance is unacceptable on large repositories, the root cause needs to be identified precisely before any mitigation is considered — including the possibility of replacing isomorphic-git with a different Git backend.

**Design considerations**:

- Expose timing data in `ExtractionResult` (e.g. `timings: { traversalMs, blobReadMs, diffMs, writeMs }`) for programmatic access and test coverage
- Consider a `--profile` flag to print per-phase timing to stderr (off by default to avoid changing default output)
- Instrument `GitAdapter.getFileChanges()` separately from commit traversal, since diff cost scales with file count per commit
- Measure first on real repositories of varying sizes; optimize only where evidence shows a bottleneck

**Why deferred to v0.3.1**: The target of this measurement is v0.3.0's file-level output performance. v0.3.0 must be complete before meaningful baseline data exists. Implementing instrumentation before the feature exists would mean measuring against an incomplete workload.

---

#### Architecture: Diff algorithm abstraction within `IsomorphicGitAdapter`

Introduce a `DiffAdapter` interface as an internal strategy within `IsomorphicGitAdapter`,
injectable via its constructor. This makes the line diff algorithm swappable without changing the
`GitAdapter` interface that core depends on.

**Motivation**:

- **Performance**: The `diff` package used today is a pure-JS implementation. A native (e.g.
  WebAssembly-backed) diff algorithm could significantly reduce per-commit processing time in
  `--per-file` mode, where a tree diff and line diff are computed for every changed file. The
  diff abstraction makes it possible to benchmark and swap implementations without touching
  anything outside `IsomorphicGitAdapter`.
- **Algorithm interchangeability**: Different diff algorithms (Myers, patience, histogram) produce
  different `additions`/`deletions` counts for the same file pair. Making the algorithm explicit
  and swappable ensures that the implementation choice is a deliberate, testable decision rather
  than an implicit consequence of whichever library was installed.

**Key design constraint — `DiffAdapter` must not surface to core**:

If a future Git backend (e.g. a libgit2-based adapter) computes tree diff and line diff as a
single native operation, splitting them at the `GitAdapter` boundary would be counterproductive.
To avoid this, `DiffAdapter` is scoped strictly as an implementation detail of
`IsomorphicGitAdapter`:

- `GitAdapter` interface remains unchanged
- `IsomorphicGitAdapter` accepts a `DiffAdapter` via constructor injection
- A future `Libgit2Adapter` would implement `GitAdapter` independently and would not use
  `DiffAdapter` at all

**Sketch**:

```ts
interface DiffAdapter {
  computeLineDiff(
    before: Uint8Array,
    after: Uint8Array,
  ): { additions: number; deletions: number } | null; // null = binary
}

class IsomorphicGitAdapter implements GitAdapter {
  constructor(
    fsImpl?: FsClient,
    diff: DiffAdapter = new JsDiffAdapter(),
  ) { ... }
}
```

**Design dependency**: Implementing this before "Granular performance profiling" is low-risk
because the change is entirely internal to `IsomorphicGitAdapter`. However, profiling data would
help prioritize which alternative `DiffAdapter` implementations to pursue first.

---

#### Output: Configurable field inclusion/exclusion

- Add `--fields` or `--exclude-fields` CLI option
- Allows omitting PII fields such as `author.email`, `committer.email`
- Enables trimming output size for use cases that don't need all fields

---

### Long-term

#### Pipeline: Pluggable enrichment stage for organization-specific metadata

Allow users to attach custom processing stages to gitrail's extraction pipeline so that
organization-specific semantics can be derived without expanding the core schema for every use
case.

Example targets include parsing commit subjects that follow conventions such as Conventional
Commits, deriving custom classification fields from file paths, or attaching additional metadata
computed from diff content.

**Design intent**:

- keep gitrail core focused on canonical Git facts and broadly reusable output grains
- move organization-specific interpretation to a user-controlled extension boundary
- allow enrichment without forcing the project to standardize every downstream analytical need

**Open design questions**:

- whether the extension point should run in-process, as an external command, or via a streaming IPC boundary
- what record shape and lifecycle guarantees plugins can rely on
- how plugin failures should affect extraction success, state writing, and reproducibility

#### Output: Branch reachability annotation per commit

Record which branch(es) each commit was reachable from at extraction time (e.g. `"branches": ["main", "develop"]` in the output JSON). This mirrors the view provided by IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA's Git log, where each commit row shows the set of branches it belongs to.

**Why deferred**: Evaluated during the v0.2.0 CLI spec design session and explicitly scoped out due to the following implementation constraints:

- **Memory**: pre-computing the reachable set for every branch scales as O(commits × branches); for repositories with many long-lived branches this is prohibitive.
- **I/O cost**: `isomorphic-git` has no bulk object API — each `readCommit()` is a separate async call. Building per-branch reachability sets requires traversing the full history once per branch.
- **Streaming incompatibility**: the current architecture emits each commit immediately during BFS traversal. Branch attribution requires knowing all branch assignments before emitting, which requires holding the full result set in memory.

**Possible future directions**:

- Post-process an already-extracted snapshot: after all commits are written, re-traverse per-branch and annotate a secondary index file.
- Limit to a configurable set of branches (e.g. `--annotate-branches main,develop`) to bound the cost.
- Consider recording only the "most specific" branch (closest tip ancestor) as a heuristic.

---

#### Output: Repository metadata override

- Add `--repo-name` and `--repo-url` flags
- Override the auto-derived `repository.name` and `repository.url` fields in output
- Useful when remote origin is not set or when a canonical name is preferred

---

#### Output: Execution metadata line

- Optionally prepend a metadata line as the first record in each output file:
  ```json
  { "_meta": { "extractedAt": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z", "extractorVersion": "1.2.0" } }
  ```
- Controlled by a `--meta` flag (off by default)

---

#### Output: stdout support and stream-based OutputWriter

Add `--output -` to write to stdout, enabling output to be piped into other tools directly.

At this point, `OutputWriter` should be redesigned around Node.js `Writable` streams rather than the current `FileHandle`-based implementation. Rewriting to a stream-based model is not warranted today — the CLI-only, batch-run use case does not benefit from it — but stdout output introduces the need to write to heterogeneous sinks (file vs. stdout), which is where the `Writable` abstraction pays off.

**Key design notes**:

- When writing to stdout, file rotation has no meaning and must be disabled or ignored gracefully.
- The `OutputWriter` abstraction could accept a `Writable` (or `AsyncIterable` sink) rather than owning file I/O directly. This removes the need for `OutputWriter` to implement rotation internally for the stdout path.
- Consider whether third-party rotation libraries (e.g. `rotating-file-stream`) become worthwhile once the file-writing path is expressed as a `Writable` pipeline. Currently the rotation logic is ~5 lines and an external dependency is not justified; evaluate at implementation time.

**Why deferred**: No current user need for stdout output. Refactoring `OutputWriter` solely for stream architecture hygiene would be over-engineering without a concrete requirement.

---

#### Other future considerations

- **Additional rotation strategies**: by commit date (one file per month/year), by branch (one file per branch)
- **Ref pattern matching**: `--branch 'feature/*'` glob support (note: temporary branches introduce risk of capturing transient data — document trade-offs)
- **Windows line endings**: `--line-ending crlf` flag (LF-only today; architecturally trivial to add)

---

## Development Environment Improvements

### Near-term

#### Code hygiene: Identifier naming audit for semantic accuracy

Several identifiers in the codebase carry names that imply a storage medium, lifecycle, or
structural pattern that the definition itself does not reflect. These are not bugs and do not
affect behavior, but they reduce the signal-to-noise ratio when reading the code and make type
names harder to reason about in isolation.

**Representative example**: `StateFile` is an interface describing a plain data structure
`{ version, generatedAt, repositoryPath, branches }`. The suffix `File` implies a storage medium,
but the interface carries no I/O semantics — that responsibility belongs to `StateStore`. A name
such as `State` or `ExtractionState` would be more accurate.

Other potential candidates (to be verified and decided at design time, not predetermined here):

- `StateBranchEntry` — "Entry" adds no meaning; `StateBranch` may be sufficient
- `PersonIdentity` — "Identity" is overloaded; `Person` or `PersonInfo` may be clearer

**Acceptable impact boundary**:

This item is scoped to changes that meet **all** of the following conditions simultaneously:

- No change to the CLI interface (flag names, behavior, exit codes)
- No change to the output JSON schema (field names, structure, `.jsonl` format)
- No change to the state file JSON format on disk (field names, `version` value)
- No behavioral change of any kind

Renames that touch only internal TypeScript identifiers — types, interfaces, type aliases, and
their import references — are within scope. Changes that require altering any of the above
boundaries must not be bundled into this item and should be tracked separately.

**At design time**: Re-examine all type and interface identifiers in `src/` for similar naming
issues before finalizing the change list. The examples above are illustrative, not exhaustive.

---

### Medium-term

#### Migrate to Node.js built-in TypeScript support

Node.js 22.6+ introduced `--experimental-strip-types` (stable in Node.js 23.6+ as `--strip-types`). This allows running `.ts` files directly without a separate `tsc` compile step.

**Current situation**: The project compiles with `tsc` → `dist/`; `package.json` `bin` points at compiled JS.

**Decision criteria**:

- Keep compiled-JS publishing for npm (broadest consumer compatibility)
- Add a `tsconfig.dev.json` for fast local iteration if needed
- Revisit seriously when Node.js ≥23 becomes the minimum LTS target
- Key changes when migrating: `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true`; remove `"js"` extensions from internal imports; separate `tsconfig.build.json` for publishing
