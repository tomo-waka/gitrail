# Architecture & Component Design

## Layer Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│           CLI Layer             │  Argument parsing, validation, error display
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│         Core Logic Layer        │  Commit traversal orchestration, JSON mapping, state file management
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│      Git Adapter Interface      │  Abstract interface — isolates isomorphic-git dependency
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│    isomorphic-git (external)    │  Actual Git object access
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer must only depend on the layer directly below it. The Core Logic layer must never import from isomorphic-git directly.

## Product Context and Design Principles

These principles govern design decisions across all layers. When a new feature or change creates
ambiguity about where logic belongs or what behavior is correct, use these as the deciding criteria.

- **gitrail is a faithful extractor, not an analytics engine.** Map Git object data exactly as
  stored. Do not infer, derive, or add attributes beyond what the spec explicitly defines. Leave
  interpretation to downstream systems.
- **The correctness guarantee is:** every commit reachable from the specified refs, within the
  specified range, appears exactly once in a single run's output. Any change that could violate
  this guarantee requires explicit justification.
- **Snapshot and incremental are user intent signals, not shortcuts.** Both modes must produce
  correct subsets of the DAG. `snapshot` = extract independently of prior state; `incremental` =
  extract only commits new since the last recorded state. Neither mode may silently produce a
  superset or a subset of the intended range.
- **Git's data model constraints are not gitrail limitations.** Commits carry no branch field;
  output order is not chronological; branch refs are mutable. These properties must be respected
  and documented, not worked around with fragile heuristics.
- **Interpretation belongs downstream.** gitrail outputs what Git stores. Derived attributes
  (e.g. branch membership per commit, authorship statistics, release attribution) are not gitrail
  responsibilities and must not be added without a deliberate spec change.

## Current Architecture Contract

This file is a current-state contract, not a release history record. Historical implementation
details belong in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Canonical vocabulary

- `CommitFact` and `FileChangeFact` are the stable Core-owned intermediate terms.
- `CheckpointStore`, `ExtractionCheckpoint`, and `BranchCheckpoint` are the stable checkpoint
  persistence terms.
- `ProfilingEntry` (`ExtractionResult.profilingEntries`) is the stable profiling term.
- `ExtractionCoordinator`, `CommitTraversalExtractor`, `FileChangeExpander`,
  `CommitRecordProjector`, `FileChangeRecordProjector`, and `OutputSink` are the stable pipeline
  stage boundaries.

### Ownership and boundary rules

- The runtime edge (`src/index.ts`) constructs `DefaultExtractionCoordinator`, stage instances,
  optional `CheckpointStore` (`--state`), `OutputSink`, and `ProgressReporter` directly.
- Core owns traversal/extraction orchestration, pipeline branching by granularity, write-loop
  progression, checkpoint commit timing, and structured progress events.
- CLI owns rendering policy (TTY vs non-TTY, spinner/heartbeat, summary/profile layout, warning
  redraw behavior) and top-level process/error behavior.
- Git adapter owns Git-native repository access and raw commit/file-change retrieval. Core must
  remain insulated from isomorphic-git details.
- Output layer owns serialization and rotation mechanics. Core must not duplicate writer rotation
  policy.

### Progress and profiling contracts

- Progress signaling is phase-aware via `ProgressReporter.emit(event)`.
- Successful non-quiet runs use stage-oriented stderr output (`Preparing extraction`,
  `Extracting history`, `Finalizing output`), then completion summary, then optional profile block.
- `--quiet` suppresses progress-stage lines, completion summary, and profile block, but warnings
  and errors remain visible.
- `ExtractionResult.profilingEntries` is hierarchical and rooted at `elapsed`.
- Adapter-facing contracts must not be polluted with profiling metadata.

### Invariants

- Checkpoint state is committed only after successful output completion and sink close.
- `OutputSink.close()` must run on both success and failure paths.
- Progress counters must advance only after successful write operations.
- Filtering by date must continue traversal (`continue`, not `break`) because traversal order is
  not chronological.

---

## Component Responsibilities

### CLI Layer (`src/cli/`)

- Parse and validate CLI arguments (see `cli.instructions.md` for full parameter spec)
- Enforce mutual-exclusion rules between parameters
- Instantiate Core and pass resolved config (including `stateFilePath` as a string — state file I/O is performed by Core, not CLI)
- Handle top-level errors and format user-facing error messages
- Exit with appropriate codes: `0` = success, `1` = user error, `2` = runtime error

### Core Logic Layer (`src/core/`)

Responsibilities:

- Orchestrate commit traversal by calling `GitAdapter`
- Map raw commit data to the output JSON schema
- Apply differential filtering (`--since-ref` / `--since-date`); uses `continue` (not `break`) for `--since-date` because BFS order is not chronological
- Read the state file at startup; write it atomically (`.tmp` → rename) only after all output files are fully flushed and closed
- Instantiate `OutputWriter` with the rotation config — rotation thresholds are enforced inside `OutputWriter`, not in Core

After the Phase 7 cleanup, `ExtractionCoordinator` owns pipeline construction, granularity
branching, the write loop, structured progress integration, sink lifecycle (`OutputSink.close()`),
and checkpoint commit timing. The runtime edge constructs the coordinator, stage instances,
checkpoint store, sink, and progress reporter directly; `Extractor` no longer exists.
`CommitTraversalExtractor`, `FileChangeExpander`, `CommitRecordProjector`, and
`FileChangeRecordProjector` own traversal, expansion, and projection respectively. `OutputSink`
(backed by `OutputWriterSink`) owns record serialization and file rotation. `CheckpointStore`
reads and writes checkpoints but does not decide timing.

Key types:

```typescript
type ExtractionRange = { type: "commit"; hash: string } | { type: "date"; since: Date };

interface ExtractorConfig {
  repositoryPath: string;
  branches: string[]; // At least one required
  outputDir: string;
  outputPrefix: string;
  rotation: RotationConfig;
  incremental: boolean;
  missingState?: "error" | "snapshot";
  perFile: boolean;
  range?: ExtractionRange;
  stateFilePath?: string;
}

interface RotationConfig {
  maxLines?: number;
  maxBytes?: number;
}
```

### Git Adapter Interface (`src/git/`)

The interface abstracts all Git operations. Core Logic must program against this interface only.

```typescript
interface GitAdapter {
  /** Resolve a ref (branch name) to a commit hash */
  resolveRef(repoPath: string, ref: string): Promise<string>;

  /** Walk commits reachable from `head`, stopping before `excludeHash` if provided.
   *  Commit order is not guaranteed — consumers must not rely on line order for
   *  chronological sorting. Each commit carries a `committer.timestamp` for that purpose. */
  walkCommits(repoPath: string, head: string, excludeHash?: string): AsyncIterable<RawCommit>;

  /** Return the remote URL for `origin`, or null if not set */
  getRemoteUrl(repoPath: string): Promise<string | null>;

  /** Return per-file change info between `commitOid` and `parentOid`.
   *  If `parentOid` is omitted (root commit), all files in the commit tree are "added".
   *  Binary files have `additions: null` and `deletions: null`. */
  getFileChanges(
    repoPath: string,
    commitOid: string,
    parentOid?: string,
  ): Promise<readonly FileChange[]>;

  /** Find the common ancestor (merge base) commit hash among all provided commit hashes.
   *  Returns null if no common ancestor exists (e.g. orphan branches). */
  findMergeBase(repoPath: string, commitHashes: string[]): Promise<string | null>;
}

interface RawCommit {
  oid: string;
  message: string;
  author: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    timestamp: number; // Unix seconds
    timezoneOffset: number; // minutes from UTC (e.g. +540 for JST)
  };
  committer: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    timestamp: number;
    timezoneOffset: number;
  };
  parents: string[];
}

interface FileChange {
  path: string;
  status: "added" | "modified" | "deleted";
  additions: number | null; // null for binary files
  deletions: number | null; // null for binary files
}
```

### isomorphic-git Adapter (`src/git/isomorphic-git-adapter.ts`)

The concrete implementation of `GitAdapter` using isomorphic-git.

- Uses `isomorphic-git`'s `readCommit()` (BFS traversal), `resolveRef()`, `getConfig()`, and `walk()` + `TREE()` (file diff) APIs
- Does **not** use isomorphic-git's `log()` API; BFS is implemented manually using `readCommit()` in a queue loop
- Implements commit exclusion via reachability pre-computation (see `git-traversal.instructions.md`)
- Must not leak isomorphic-git types outside this file
- Accepts an optional `FsClient` in its constructor for dependency injection (defaults to `node:fs`)

### Output Layer (`src/output/`)

- Serialize `OutputRecord` objects (`OutputCommit | OutputFileRecord`) to JSON Lines
- Track current file's line count and byte size
- Rotate to a new file when thresholds are exceeded
- Generate output filenames: `{prefix}-{timestamp}-{sequenceNumber padded to 6 digits}.jsonl`
- Use `\n` (LF) as line endings — never `\r\n`

---

## File Layout Convention

Every layer follows a consistent two-file pattern:

- **`types.ts`** — all TypeScript interfaces and type aliases for that layer. No runtime code.
- **`index.ts`** — re-export barrel only. No type definitions or logic.

This separation keeps type definitions discoverable and helps prevent circular imports between layers.

---

## State File

Managed by Core Logic. Written atomically (write to temp file, then rename).

Schema:

```typescript
interface ExtractionCheckpoint {
  version: 1;
  generatedAt: string; // ISO 8601
  repositoryPath: string;
  branches: readonly Array<{
    name: string;
    lastCommitHash: string;
  }>;
}
```

Rules:

- State file is written **only after all output files for that run are fully flushed and closed**
- If extraction fails mid-run, the previous state file must remain unchanged
- On next run, if a branch in the state file no longer exists in the repo, log a warning and skip that branch

---

## Error Handling Conventions

- All errors thrown from the Git Adapter must be wrapped in a `GitAdapterError` before propagating to Core
- User-facing errors (invalid args, missing repo, hash not found) must produce a clear single-line message without a stack trace
- Internal/unexpected errors should include the stack trace for debugging

### `GitAdapterError` Definition

```typescript
type GitAdapterErrorCode =
  | "REF_NOT_FOUND" // Specified branch/ref does not exist in the repository
  | "COMMIT_NOT_FOUND" // Specified commit hash does not exist or is not reachable
  | "NOT_A_REPOSITORY" // Target path is not a Git repository
  | "REMOTE_NOT_FOUND" // Remote origin is not configured (non-fatal; triggers fallback)
  | "UNKNOWN"; // Unexpected error from the underlying library

class GitAdapterError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public readonly code: GitAdapterErrorCode,
    public readonly cause?: unknown,
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "GitAdapterError";
  }
}
```

### Error Code Handling in Core Logic

Core Logic must inspect `code` to determine the appropriate response:

| Code               | Severity  | Core Behaviour                                               |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `REF_NOT_FOUND`    | Fatal     | Abort with user-facing error message                         |
| `COMMIT_NOT_FOUND` | Fatal     | Abort with user-facing error message                         |
| `NOT_A_REPOSITORY` | Fatal     | Abort with user-facing error message                         |
| `REMOTE_NOT_FOUND` | Non-fatal | Log a warning; fall back to directory name for output prefix |
| `UNKNOWN`          | Fatal     | Abort; include stack trace in output                         |
