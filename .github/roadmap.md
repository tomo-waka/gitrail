# gitrail — Feature Roadmap

This file records all planned improvements beyond the initial release: product features, CLI UX improvements, and development environment tasks.

Items are grouped by expected priority order within each section. Final ordering is subject to review.

This roadmap is intentionally organized by product priority and time horizon, not by release version. When an item is selected for a specific release, annotate it with lightweight metadata instead of moving it to a different section.

### Metadata Convention

Roadmap entries use the following standardized metadata labels, placed immediately below the entry title:

- **Release target**: `vX.Y.Z` — added when an item is selected for a release during planning
- **Depends on**: Entry title(s) — indicates dependencies on other roadmap items

## Product Improvements

### Near-term

#### Extraction/File Mode: Exact-content rename detection (limited scope)

gitrail currently emits file changes as `added` / `modified` / `deleted` based on path-level tree
comparison and does not detect rename/move relationships. As a result, a pure file move appears as
one full-path deletion plus one full-path addition, even when file content is unchanged.

This near-term item introduces an explicit, limited-scope rename detection mode for the most
deterministic case: pairing `deleted` and `added` records when blob identity is exactly equal.

**Design intent**:

- provide a practical first step for move-aware extraction without introducing heuristic ambiguity
- keep default behavior backward compatible unless explicitly enabled
- treat this as file-level rename detection; directory rename is represented as a set of file
  renames, not as a separate Git primitive

**Scope boundary (initial delivery)**:

- detect only exact-content moves (equivalent to `R100` style outcomes)
- do not infer rename when content has changed in the same commit
- keep merge behavior aligned with current first-parent comparison semantics

**Questions to resolve at design time**:

- whether rename output should be represented via a new status/value shape or by optional
  `oldPath`/`newPath` fields while preserving existing consumers
- whether the feature should be opt-in via CLI (preferred for compatibility) or enabled by default
- how to handle one-to-many and many-to-one exact matches deterministically
- what summary/profile counters should be emitted so users can audit rename pairing impact

#### CLI UX: User-controlled color policy for non-TTY and CI logs

For v0.6.0, color output is intentionally auto-disabled in non-TTY contexts and no user-facing
override option is introduced. That default keeps redirected output and scripted usage stable.

This item evaluates a future CLI color policy option surface that preserves the current safe
default while allowing explicit operator control when non-TTY color is desirable.

**Design intent**:

- keep default behavior as `auto` (TTY-aware enablement, non-TTY disablement)
- provide explicit overrides for advanced workflows (for example CI log viewers or pagers)
- maintain deterministic behavior and avoid surprising ANSI escape leakage in machine-oriented
  pipelines

**Options to evaluate**:

- CLI shape: `--color <auto|always|never>` vs boolean-style split flags
- environment-variable interoperability (`NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR`)
- precedence rules between CLI option, environment variables, and TTY detection
- documentation and troubleshooting guidance for Windows terminal/CI differences

**Non-goal for this item**:

- no redesign of JSON output contracts; this is terminal presentation policy only

### Medium-term

#### Extraction/File Mode: Similarity-based rename detection for edited moves

Exact-content pairing alone is insufficient for common real-world moves where files are renamed and
edited in the same commit. This item extends the limited near-term rename mode with
similarity-based matching between deleted and added candidates.

Unlike exact-content pairing, this is inherently heuristic. The design must therefore make
fidelity, runtime cost, and determinism explicit and user-controllable.

**Design intent**:

- support rename detection when content changes during the move
- keep matching behavior transparent and reproducible under fixed settings
- avoid silent extraction-policy shifts by exposing thresholds and guardrails

**Design/implementation considerations**:

- similarity threshold model (single threshold vs tiered behavior)
- candidate matching strategy and deterministic tie-breaking
- runtime guardrails for large candidate sets to prevent worst-case blowups
- compatibility with existing per-file metrics (`additions` / `deletions`) and profiling output

**Open policy questions**:

- whether copy detection should be out of scope initially and kept as a separate future item
- whether this mode should remain opt-in even after stabilization
- how explicitly the CLI/docs should label outputs as inferred relationships rather than stored Git
  facts

#### Architecture/Runtime: Worker-based extraction runtime for resilience and orchestration

The current extraction pipeline runs in a single Node.js execution context. This keeps the
implementation straightforward, but it also couples heavy extraction work with CLI lifecycle and
interactive rendering. For long-running or computationally heavy workloads, this coupling makes
stability, supervision, and execution strategy evolution harder than necessary.

This item introduces a Worker-based runtime boundary: extraction executes in an isolated worker,
while the main process remains responsible for CLI lifecycle, supervision, and user interaction.

**Primary goals (core value)**:

- improve long-run extraction stability via execution isolation
- improve fault tolerance through clear failure boundaries and controlled shutdown semantics
- establish a foundation for future orchestration flexibility (parallelism, scheduling, retry)
- improve extensibility by formalizing runtime and messaging boundaries

**Secondary outcomes (expected but non-primary)**:

- smoother progress behavior under heavy extraction load
- cleaner profiling/telemetry boundaries between extraction work and CLI supervision

**Scope strategy (single entry, phased delivery)**:

- **Phase A: runtime boundary only**
  - run the existing extraction pipeline in one worker
  - define a typed message protocol for progress, warning, result, and error events
  - keep extraction semantics and output behavior unchanged
- **Phase B: operational hardening**
  - add cancellation, timeout, and supervision semantics
  - make failure reporting and exit behavior deterministic
- **Phase C: orchestration-ready foundation**
  - prepare interfaces for future parallel strategies (branch-level or stage-level)
  - do not require immediate parallel execution in this item

**Non-goals for initial implementation**:

- no guaranteed throughput improvement in the first delivery
- no implicit data reduction or extraction-fidelity trade-off
- no simultaneous rollout of broad parallel execution and plugin architecture

**Design constraints**:

- preserve current extraction correctness and checkpoint safety guarantees
- maintain deterministic behavior under equivalent inputs and configuration
- keep CLI UX backward compatible unless explicitly documented otherwise

#### Architecture: Diff algorithm abstraction within `IsomorphicGitAdapter`

Introduce a `DiffAdapter` interface as an internal strategy within `IsomorphicGitAdapter`,
injectable via its constructor. This makes the line diff algorithm swappable without changing the
`GitAdapter` interface that core depends on.

**Motivation**:

- **Performance**: The `diff` package used today is a pure-JS implementation. A native (e.g.
  WebAssembly-backed) diff algorithm could significantly reduce per-commit processing time in
  `--per-file` mode, where a tree diff and line diff are computed for every changed file. The
  diff abstraction makes it possible to benchmark and swap implementations without touching
  anything outside `IsomorphicGitAdapter`.
- **Algorithm interchangeability**: Different diff algorithms (Myers, patience, histogram) produce
  different `additions`/`deletions` counts for the same file pair. Making the algorithm explicit
  and swappable ensures that the implementation choice is a deliberate, testable decision rather
  than an implicit consequence of whichever library was installed.

**Key design constraint — `DiffAdapter` must not surface to core**:

If a future Git backend (e.g. a libgit2-based adapter) computes tree diff and line diff as a
single native operation, splitting them at the `GitAdapter` boundary would be counterproductive.
To avoid this, `DiffAdapter` is scoped strictly as an implementation detail of
`IsomorphicGitAdapter`:

- `GitAdapter` interface remains unchanged
- `IsomorphicGitAdapter` accepts a `DiffAdapter` via constructor injection
- A future `Libgit2Adapter` would implement `GitAdapter` independently and would not use
  `DiffAdapter` at all

**Sketch**:

```ts
interface DiffAdapter {
  computeLineDiff(
    before: Uint8Array,
    after: Uint8Array,
  ): { additions: number; deletions: number } | null; // null = binary
}

class IsomorphicGitAdapter implements GitAdapter {
  constructor(
    fsImpl?: FsClient,
    diff: DiffAdapter = new JsDiffAdapter(),
  ) { ... }
}
```

**Design dependency**: This remains low-risk because the change is entirely internal to
`IsomorphicGitAdapter`. Profiling data from the implemented `--profile` baseline can guide which
alternative `DiffAdapter` implementations to prioritize first.

#### Output: Configurable field inclusion/exclusion

This is an output-surface convenience feature rather than a core extraction requirement. In many
pipelines, downstream warehouses can drop or mask columns after ingest, so the feature's value is
strongest when users need to minimize exposure or payload size at extraction time instead of in a
later projection step.

- Add `--fields` or `--exclude-fields` CLI option
- Allows omitting PII fields such as `author.email`, `committer.email` when source-side control is
  desirable
- Enables trimming output size for use cases that do not need all fields, while keeping the
  default extraction contract fully populated

---

### Long-term

---

#### Development: Profiling interpretation model and usability

The current profiling implementation is already sufficient as a measurement foundation, but its
output still requires internal code knowledge to interpret confidently. This is not an urgent
performance bottleneck item; it is a long-term quality improvement for profiling readability,
operational diagnostics, and future optimization planning.

**Current pain points observed after Phase 6**:

- The relationship between pipeline phases (planning/traversal/projection/write) and git-internal
  stages (`git/*`) is difficult to understand without knowing the program structure.
- Nested scoped timings in the git stage can express containment, but are still hard to read in
  day-to-day diagnostics.

**Long-term improvement goals**:

- Add a stable phase-to-git stage mapping model and document it explicitly.
- Add self-time style visibility in addition to inclusive stage timings so local bottlenecks are
  easier to identify.
- Add count metrics alongside timing metrics (for example: read-commit calls, visited commits,
  excluded commits, blob reads, diff invocations) to distinguish expensive-per-call from many-call
  workloads.
- Provide multiple profile views for different audiences (hierarchical detailed view, phase-level
  summary, and top-contributor summary).
- Add machine-readable profile export (for example JSON) for cross-run comparison and CI trend
  analysis.
- Clarify profiling interpretation guidance in docs, including nested timing semantics and overlap
  behavior.
- Evaluate and document profiling overhead characteristics to reduce over-interpretation of tiny
  runs.

**Design intent**:

- Keep the existing profiling behavior as the stable baseline.
- Treat these items as interpretation and observability UX improvements, not as mandatory
  preconditions for current extraction correctness.

#### Pipeline: Pluggable enrichment stage for organization-specific metadata

Allow users to attach custom processing stages (plugins) to gitrail's extraction pipeline so that
organization-specific semantics can be derived without expanding the core schema for every use
case.

Example targets include parsing commit subjects that follow conventions such as Conventional
Commits, deriving custom classification fields from file paths, or attaching additional metadata
computed from diff content.

**Design intent**:

- keep gitrail core focused on canonical Git facts and broadly reusable output grains
- move organization-specific interpretation to a user-controlled extension boundary
- allow enrichment without forcing the project to standardize every downstream analytical need

**Architecture**:

- **Plugin implementation**: Users implement the `ProjectorPlugin` interface (`init?(): Promise<InitResult>` and `project(context, profiler?): Promise<ProjectionResult>`).
- **Config-driven loading**: Plugins are loaded from a configuration file (format TBD — see **Open Design Question: CLI Interface** below) and instantiated via a `PluginFactory` function.
- **Plugin types**:
  - **npm packages** (e.g., `commit-message-analyze-projector`): Published plugins with shared logic and configuration.
  - **script injection** (experimental): Local JavaScript files or modules with user-defined logic. No capability restrictions in initial implementation; security review and sandboxing deferred to future roadmap item.
  - **IPC-based plugins** (future): External processes communicating via stdio (aligns with Worker-based runtime item).
- **Execution model**:
  - Sequential per-fact execution (no implicit parallelization in Phase 1).
  - Plugins run after `DefaultFactProjector` and before output sink.
  - Each plugin sees the base canonical record (from `DefaultFactProjector`) and the `Fact` input; other plugins' outputs are not visible (order independence).
  - Plugins contribute data to the `extensions` field in the output record, keyed by namespace.

**Type contract** (core types):

```ts
export type InitResult =
  | { readonly type: "ready" }
  | { readonly type: "fatal"; readonly message: string };

export interface ProjectionContext {
  readonly fact: Fact;
  readonly baseRecord: Readonly<OutputRecord>; // from DefaultFactProjector
}

export type ProjectionResult =
  | { readonly type: "success"; readonly data: Record<string, unknown> }
  | { readonly type: "skip"; readonly reason: string }
  | { readonly type: "fatal"; readonly message: string };

export interface ProjectorPlugin {
  init?(): Promise<InitResult>;
  project(context: ProjectionContext, profiler?: StageProfiler): Promise<ProjectionResult>;
}
```

**Output format** (backward compatible):

- The `extensions` field is added to `OutputRecord` when plugins are configured; it is absent otherwise.
- Structure: `extensions: { [namespace: string]: { [key: string]: unknown } | null }`.
  - `null` value indicates a plugin returned `"skip"` for that fact.
  - This addition is non-breaking: existing consumers ignore the field; new consumers opt-in to plugin data.

**Plugin failure handling**:

- **Default policy**: `"skip-fact"` — a plugin failure skips only that fact's enrichment; extraction continues.
- **Alternative policy** (per-plugin): `"fatal"` — halts extraction, no state update.
- Both policies emit warnings to the progress reporter.
- Plugin timeout (if enforced) follows the configured failure policy.

**Entrypoint resolution** (for config entry `"entrypoint": "xxx"`):

1. Try as local file path: `./plugins/xxx.js`, `./plugins/xxx/index.js`, etc.
2. Try as npm module: `require.resolve("xxx")`.
3. Error if neither resolves.

**Compatibility and constraints**:

- State writing is not affected by plugin success or failure; state updates only after core extraction completes.
- Plugins must not throw unhandled exceptions; they must return `InitResult.fatal` or `ProjectionResult.fatal` for errors.
- Profile data: each plugin receives an optional scoped profiler for self-instrumentation.
- Namespace validation: performed at config parse time; namespaces must be unique and match pattern `[a-z0-9-]+`.

**Scope boundaries (initial Phase 1 implementation)**:

- **In scope**: Single-process execution, init/project lifecycle, success/skip/fatal result contract, timeout control, profiler injection, namespace isolation, config loading (format TBD).
- **Out of scope**: capability sandboxing for scripts, plugin output schema validation (defer to separate roadmap item), parallel execution, worker-thread boundaries (addressed by Worker-based Runtime item).
- **Experimental**: `ScriptInjectProjector` — marked unstable; no security hardening in Phase 1; subject to future security review and capability restrictions.

**Implementation guidance**:

- Suggested order: (1) type definitions and plugin contract, (2) `DefaultFactProjector` refactor to extract single-record projection logic, (3) plugin config parsing and factory resolution, (4) `EnrichingFactProjector` orchestrator, (5) integration into `ExtractionCoordinator`, (6) basic example plugins.

**Open Design Questions**:

1. **CLI interface for plugin config**: How should plugins be specified at runtime?
   - Option A: `--plugins-config ./gitrail-plugins.json`
   - Option B: `--plugins-dir ./plugins/` with auto-discovery
   - Option C: Environment variable + file discovery heuristics
   - **Status**: Deferred to planning phase; scope to be finalized before implementation begins.
   - Consider interactions with eventual Config File redesign and CLI ergonomics roadmap items.
2. **Plugin documentation and examples**: Scope to be defined in a companion roadmap entry (see **Defer to separate entry** below).

**Defer to separate entry**:

- Documentation, tutorials, and examples for plugin authorship (including Conventional Commits parser reference implementation, custom-tagger template, etc.) — scope for a dedicated UX/docs roadmap item.

#### Output: Branch reachability annotation per commit

Record which branch(es) each commit was reachable from at extraction time (e.g. `"branches": ["main", "develop"]` in the output JSON). This mirrors the view provided by IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA's Git log, where each commit row shows the set of branches it belongs to.

**Why deferred**: Evaluated during the v0.2.0 CLI spec design session and explicitly scoped out due to the following implementation constraints:

- **Memory**: pre-computing the reachable set for every branch scales as O(commits × branches); for repositories with many long-lived branches this is prohibitive.
- **I/O cost**: `isomorphic-git` has no bulk object API — each `readCommit()` is a separate async call. Building per-branch reachability sets requires traversing the full history once per branch.
- **Streaming incompatibility**: the current architecture emits each commit immediately during BFS traversal. Branch attribution requires knowing all branch assignments before emitting, which requires holding the full result set in memory.

**Possible future directions**:

- Post-process an already-extracted snapshot: after all commits are written, re-traverse per-branch and annotate a secondary index file.
- Limit to a configurable set of branches (e.g. `--annotate-branches main,develop`) to bound the cost.
- Consider recording only the "most specific" branch (closest tip ancestor) as a heuristic.

---

#### Output: Execution metadata line

- Optionally prepend a metadata line as the first record in each output file:
  ```json
  { "_meta": { "extractedAt": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z", "extractorVersion": "1.2.0" } }
  ```
- Controlled by a `--meta` flag (off by default)

---

#### Output: stdout support and stream-based OutputWriter

Add `--output -` to write to stdout, enabling output to be piped into other tools directly.

At this point, `OutputWriter` should be redesigned around Node.js `Writable` streams rather than the current `FileHandle`-based implementation. Rewriting to a stream-based model is not warranted today — the CLI-only, batch-run use case does not benefit from it — but stdout output introduces the need to write to heterogeneous sinks (file vs. stdout), which is where the `Writable` abstraction pays off.

**Key design notes**:

- When writing to stdout, file rotation has no meaning and must be disabled or ignored gracefully.
- The `OutputWriter` abstraction could accept a `Writable` (or `AsyncIterable` sink) rather than owning file I/O directly. This removes the need for `OutputWriter` to implement rotation internally for the stdout path.
- Consider whether third-party rotation libraries (e.g. `rotating-file-stream`) become worthwhile once the file-writing path is expressed as a `Writable` pipeline. Currently the rotation logic is ~5 lines and an external dependency is not justified; evaluate at implementation time.

**Why deferred**: No current user need for stdout output. Refactoring `OutputWriter` solely for stream architecture hygiene would be over-engineering without a concrete requirement.

---

#### Other future considerations

- **Additional rotation strategies**: by commit date (one file per month/year), by branch (one file per branch)
- **Ref pattern matching**: `--branch 'feature/*'` glob support (note: temporary branches introduce risk of capturing transient data — document trade-offs)
- **Windows line endings**: `--line-ending crlf` flag (LF-only today; architecturally trivial to add)

## Development Environment Improvements

### Medium-term

#### Migrate to Node.js built-in TypeScript support

Node.js 22.6+ introduced `--experimental-strip-types` (stable in Node.js 23.6+ as `--strip-types`). This allows running `.ts` files directly without a separate `tsc` compile step.

**Current situation**: The project compiles with `tsc` → `dist/`; `package.json` `bin` points at compiled JS.

**Decision criteria**:

- Keep compiled-JS publishing for npm (broadest consumer compatibility)
- Add a `tsconfig.dev.json` for fast local iteration if needed
- Revisit seriously when Node.js ≥23 becomes the minimum LTS target
- Key changes when migrating: `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true`; remove `"js"` extensions from internal imports; separate `tsconfig.build.json` for publishing
