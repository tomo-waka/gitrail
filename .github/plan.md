# gitrail — v0.7.0 Release Plan

## Overview

v0.7.0 is a plugin architecture release focused on enabling organization-specific enrichment in the extraction pipeline while keeping the core Git fact model stable. The release also includes adjacent package compatibility policy and a contained Git diff abstraction needed for future optimization flexibility.

## Release Goals

- Deliver pluggable enrichment execution as a first-class extension point
- Define official plugin distribution and compatibility policy for `@gitlode/*` packages
- Isolate line-diff algorithm choice behind an internal adapter without changing core `GitAdapter` contracts

## Scope Summary

### Included in v0.7.0

- `Pipeline: Pluggable enrichment stage for organization-specific metadata`
- `Distribution/Compatibility: Official plugin package policy and version contract`
- `Architecture: Diff algorithm abstraction within IsomorphicGitAdapter`

### Explicitly excluded from v0.7.0

- `Architecture/Runtime: Worker-based extraction runtime baseline for resilience and supervision`
- `Architecture/Runtime: Orchestration-ready expansion of the extraction runtime foundation`
- `Release Engineering: Staged monorepo CI/CD evolution with changesets adoption`
- `Extraction/File Mode: Exact-content rename detection (limited scope)`
- `Extraction/File Mode: Similarity-based rename detection for edited moves`
- `CLI UX: User-controlled color policy for non-TTY and CI logs`
- `Output: Configurable field inclusion/exclusion`
- `Development: Profiling interpretation model and usability`
