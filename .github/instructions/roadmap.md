# gitrail — Feature Roadmap

This file records all planned improvements beyond the initial release: product features, CLI UX improvements, and development environment tasks.

Items are grouped by expected priority order within each section. Final ordering is subject to review.

---

## Completed: v0.1.0 — Initial Release

- Commit-level extraction with fixed schema
- JSON Lines output with `\n` line endings
- Branch-based traversal (one or more refs as starting points)
- Full and differential extraction (`--state`, `--since-commit`, `--since-date`)
- File rotation by line count and byte size
- Output filename prefix derived from remote origin
- State file for incremental run management
- CI (GitHub Actions): build, lint, format check, tests
- Release workflow: npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC)

---

## Product Improvements

### Near-term

#### Bug: `--help` argument list not displaying

`node dist/index.js --help` shows only the command name and description — argument definitions are not displayed.

**Root cause**: `src/index.ts` defines `main` via `defineCommand({ meta, run() {...} })` without an `args` property. The `argsDef` / `cmdDefinition` object lives in `src/cli/args.ts` but is never wired into `main`.

**Fix**: Import `cmdDefinition` from `src/cli/index.js` and spread it into the `defineCommand` call in `src/index.ts`:

```ts
import { cmdDefinition } from "./cli/index.js";

const main = defineCommand({
  ...cmdDefinition,   // brings in meta + args
  async run() { ... },
});
```

**Verification**: `node dist/index.js --help` lists all 9 parameters with descriptions and defaults.

---

#### CLI UX: Progress reporting and post-run summary

**Progress reporting during extraction**

Currently the CLI is completely silent during extraction. For large repositories this gives no feedback to the user.

- Display periodic progress to stderr (e.g. `\rProcessed N commits...` updated in-place every ~100 commits, flushed with `\n` at end)
- Always write progress to **stderr** — must not corrupt JSONL output if stdout is piped
- Add `--quiet` flag to suppress progress output (for CI / cron usage)
- Design options to evaluate: simple counter vs lightweight library (`cli-progress`, `ora`) — evaluate bundle size impact first

**Post-run summary**

After extraction completes, print to stderr:

- Number of commits written
- Number of output files created
- Total bytes written
- Elapsed wall-clock time
- Which branches were processed

**Implementation note**: `Extractor.run()` currently returns `void`. To surface summary data, change the return type to an `ExtractionResult` object (e.g. `{ commitsWritten, filesCreated, bytesWritten, branches }`). The CLI layer in `src/index.ts` formats and prints it to stderr.

---

#### CLI UX: `--help` option grouping and discoverability

The `--help` output lists all options in a flat list with no grouping. The jump from "I want incremental extraction" to "I need `--state`" is non-obvious.

- Group options under section headers: **Output**, **Differential Extraction**, **File Rotation**
- Add a note to the `--state` description: "Primary mechanism for scheduled/incremental runs"
- Evaluate whether citty supports option grouping natively; if not, consider a custom help renderer

---

### Medium-term

#### CLI spec: Explicit extraction mode and state ergonomics

**Problem A — implicit intent**: A user who always intends full extraction but accidentally passes `--state` pointing to an existing file will silently get differential output. There is no explicit intent signal.

**Problem B — no force-full flag**: If a user has been using `--state` for incremental runs but wants a one-time full re-extraction (e.g. schema change upstream), they must manually delete the state file.

**Problem C — state file path always manual**: The user must pass `--state ./somewhere/state.json` on every invocation. A natural default would be co-locating it with the output files.

**Problem D — missing-state behavior not configurable**: If the state file is deleted or corrupted mid-series, the next run silently falls back to full extraction. Downstream DWH consumers may receive duplicate records.

**Candidate improvements**:

- `--mode full|incremental` flag to make intent explicit; `full` ignores state file content but still updates it after the run
- `--state-dir <dir>` option that auto-derives the state filename from `<output-prefix>` (e.g. `<dir>/<prefix>.state.json`), reducing per-invocation configuration
- `--on-missing-state error|warn|full` flag to control behavior when state file is expected but absent
- Document explicitly in README: state file does not survive ephemeral CI workspaces; recommend artifact caching strategies

---

#### Correctness: Cross-run deduplication for newly added branches

When a branch is added to `--branch` in a subsequent run, its full traversal may output commits already extracted by a prior run via a different branch sharing history.

**Fix**: At run start, compute the merge base between the new branch and all branches already recorded in the state file. Use the merge base as `excludeHash` for the new branch's traversal.

- Requires `findMergeBase()` support in the Git Adapter
- Does not require storing all previously output hashes
- See `git-traversal.instructions.md` — "Future Work: Cross-Run Deduplication for New Branches"

---

#### Output: Configurable field inclusion/exclusion

- Add `--fields` or `--exclude-fields` CLI option
- Allows omitting PII fields such as `author.email`, `committer.email`
- Enables trimming output size for use cases that don't need all fields

---

### Long-term

#### Output: Repository metadata override

- Add `--repo-name` and `--repo-url` flags
- Override the auto-derived `repository.name` and `repository.url` fields in output
- Useful when remote origin is not set or when a canonical name is preferred

---

#### Output: Execution metadata line

- Optionally prepend a metadata line as the first record in each output file:
  ```json
  { "_meta": { "extractedAt": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z", "extractorVersion": "1.2.0" } }
  ```
- Controlled by a `--meta` flag (off by default)

---

#### Output: Commit file diff stats

- For each commit, include an array of changed files with `path`, `status`, `additions`, `deletions`
- Made opt-in via `--include-files` flag (more expensive — requires tree comparison per commit)
- Implementation: requires `isomorphic-git`'s `walk()` API with tree diff

---

#### Output: File-level output mode

- New mode where each output record represents a single changed **file** within a commit (rather than the commit itself)
- Controlled by `--output-mode file` (default: `commit`)
- Depends on commit file diff stats being implemented first

---

#### Other future considerations

- **Additional rotation strategies**: by commit date (one file per month/year), by branch (one file per branch)
- **Ref pattern matching**: `--branch 'feature/*'` glob support (note: temporary branches introduce risk of capturing transient data — document trade-offs)
- **Streaming to stdout**: `--output -` to write to stdout for piping into other tools
- **Windows line endings**: `--line-ending crlf` flag (LF-only today; architecturally trivial to add)

---

## Development Environment Improvements

### Near-term

#### Fix: `eslint.config.js` deprecated config syntax

Current `eslint.config.js` uses a spread of `tseslint.configs.recommended` into `tseslint.config()`, which is marked as deprecated. Update to the current recommended flat config pattern when revisiting.

Check the `typescript-eslint` docs for the current idiomatic approach at that time.

---

#### Refactor: TypeScript `readonly` audit

All current interfaces and types (`RawCommit`, `GitAdapter`, `ExtractorConfig`, `RotationConfig`, `StateFile`, `OutputCommit`, etc.) are defined without `readonly` modifiers.

**Approach**:

1. Start with pure data/value types (interfaces used only as data carriers)
2. Mark all fields `readonly`
3. Work inward to classes/logic that construct or mutate them
4. Leave fields mutable only where there is a deliberate reason

Particularly: `RawCommit`, `OutputCommit`, `StateFile`, `ExtractorConfig` should be fully readonly. Collections used as read-only input (e.g. `branches: string[]`) should be `readonly string[]`.

---

### Long-term

#### Migrate to Node.js built-in TypeScript support

Node.js 22.6+ introduced `--experimental-strip-types` (stable in Node.js 23.6+ as `--strip-types`). This allows running `.ts` files directly without a separate `tsc` compile step.

**Current situation**: The project compiles with `tsc` → `dist/`; `package.json` `bin` points at compiled JS.

**Decision criteria**:

- Keep compiled-JS publishing for npm (broadest consumer compatibility)
- Add a `tsconfig.dev.json` for fast local iteration if needed
- Revisit seriously when Node.js ≥23 becomes the minimum LTS target
- Key changes when migrating: `"allowImportingTsExtensions": true`; remove `"js"` extensions from internal imports; separate `tsconfig.build.json` for publishing
