# gitlode — User Guide

gitlode extracts Git commit history from a local repository and writes it as
[JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) (`.jsonl`) files — one record per line — suitable for
ingestion into data warehouses, analytics platforms, or any system that consumes
newline-delimited JSON.

---

## Extraction Modes

gitlode has two extraction modes:

### Snapshot mode (default)

By default (no `--incremental` flag), gitlode extracts commits independently of any prior state. It always walks from the
current tip of the specified branch(es) back through history. No state file is consulted during
extraction.

**When to use:**

- One-time or ad-hoc extraction
- Extracting commits since a specific release tag via `--since-ref`
- Resetting or re-initializing an incremental workflow

### Incremental mode

`--incremental` reads a state file to determine where the previous extraction ended, then
extracts only commits added since that point.

**When to use:**

- Regularly feeding new commits into a data warehouse or analytics pipeline
- Long-running repositories where re-extracting everything on each run is costly

Incremental mode requires `--state`.

> **Note:** State tracking now covers all supported ref types (branches, tags, and raw commit OIDs).
> For static refs (annotated tags and raw commit OIDs), checkpoints are still recorded, but future
> incremental runs usually produce zero new records unless the ref target changes.

---

## Typical Workflows

### 1. One-time analysis

Extract all commits reachable from a branch:

```bash
gitlode --ref main ./my-repo
# or with shorthand aliases
gitlode -r main ./my-repo
```

Output is written to `./my-repo-<timestamp>-000001.jsonl` (prefix derived from the remote origin
URL, or the directory name if no remote is configured).

---

### 2. Continuous incremental extraction

For pipelines that regularly load new commits into a data warehouse.

> gitlode reads only the local `.git` directory. To pick up newly pushed commits, run
> `git fetch` before each gitlode invocation. Note that `git fetch` updates **remote-tracking
> refs** (e.g. `origin/main`), not local branch refs (`main`). Use the remote-tracking ref
> name with `--ref` (e.g. `-r origin/main`) so that a plain `git fetch` is sufficient.
> Alternatively, use `git pull` to advance the local branch, or work with a **bare clone**
> where `git fetch` updates refs directly.

**Step 1 — initialize state (once):**

```bash
gitlode -r main -s ./gitlode-state.json ./my-repo
```

This extracts all commits and writes a state file recording the current HEAD of each branch.

**Step 2 — all subsequent runs:**

```bash
git -C ./my-repo fetch origin
gitlode --incremental -r origin/main -s ./gitlode-state.json ./my-repo
```

Only commits added since the last run are extracted. The state file is updated on success.

**Simplified: auto-initialize with `--missing-state snapshot`**

If you prefer a single command that handles both the first run and all subsequent runs:

```bash
gitlode --incremental -r main -s ./gitlode-state.json --missing-state snapshot ./my-repo
```

- First run (state file absent): emits a warning to stderr, performs full extraction, creates
  the state file.
- Subsequent runs: differential extraction as normal.

---

### 3. Extract commits since a release tag

Use `--since-ref` to extract only commits that appeared after a given ref — equivalent to
`git log <ref>..<branch>`:

```bash
# All commits on main that are not reachable from v1.0
gitlode -r main --since-ref v1.0 ./my-repo
```

`--since-ref` accepts a tag name, branch name, or full commit object ID (OID).

**With state recording** (for subsequent incremental runs):

```bash
gitlode -r main -r develop --since-ref v1.0 -s ./gitlode-state.json ./my-repo
```

> **Note:** The state file records each branch's current HEAD OID — not the `--since-ref`
> boundary. A subsequent incremental run picks up commits since the HEAD recorded at this run,
> not since `v1.0`. If a branch's HEAD is reachable from the since-ref (meaning zero commits
> would be output for that branch), gitlode emits a warning to stderr.

> **Compatibility note:** Runtime support is currently limited to repositories using the `sha1`
> object format. Unsupported formats fail before traversal/output with:
> `Unsupported repository object format: <format>. Supported formats: sha1.`

---

### 4. CI and ephemeral environments

In CI pipelines where the environment is recreated on each run, choose the approach that fits
your setup:

**Option A — stateless snapshot (simplest)**

```bash
gitlode -r main ./my-repo
```

No state file required. Suitable when the downstream system handles deduplication
(e.g. upsert by `oid`).

**Option B — incremental with persistent state**

Store the state file on a persistent volume mounted into the container:

```bash
gitlode --incremental -r main \
  -s /mnt/state/gitlode-state.json \
  --missing-state snapshot \
  ./my-repo
```

`--missing-state snapshot` ensures the first run after a new deployment or volume recreation
succeeds without manual intervention.

---

## State File Management

### What the state file records

After a successful run, gitlode writes a JSON file at the path given by `--state`. It records a
checkpoint entry for each processed ref at extraction time:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "generatedAt": "2024-06-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "repositoryPath": "/absolute/path/to/my-repo",
  "refs": [
    {
      "ref": "main",
      "refType": "branch",
      "tipOid": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
      "updatedAt": "2024-06-01T12:00:00.000Z"
    },
    {
      "ref": "v1.0",
      "refType": "tag-lightweight",
      "tipOid": "d4e5f6a7b8c9...",
      "updatedAt": "2024-06-01T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Role of `--state` in each mode

| Mode          | State file read?     | State file written?                            |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `snapshot`    | No (content ignored) | Yes (created or overwritten on success)        |
| `incremental` | Yes                  | Yes (updated with current HEAD OID on success) |

In snapshot mode, `--state` serves only as a recording path — prior content has no effect on
extraction. This makes it safe to run without `--incremental` to re-initialize state without affecting
any output.

### `--missing-state`

Controls behavior when `--incremental` is used and the state file does not exist:

| Value             | Behavior                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `error` (default) | Exits with code 1. Requires manual state initialization before the first incremental run. |
| `snapshot`        | Emits a warning to stderr, performs full extraction, and creates the state file.          |

### State file location

gitlode does not infer a default path. Specify `--state <path>` explicitly and choose a location
that persists across runs.

---

## Multi-Branch Extraction

Specify `--ref` (or `-r`) multiple times to extract from several branches in one run:

```bash
gitlode -r main -r develop -r release/1.x ./my-repo
```

**Deduplication:** commits shared between refs are written exactly once. gitlode maintains a
visited OID set across all refs within a single run.

**Output order:** all commits from the first ref are written before the second ref begins,
in the order `--ref` arguments were given.

### Adding a new branch to an existing incremental workflow

When a **branch** listed in `--ref` has no matching `(ref, refType)` entry in the state file,
gitlode automatically prevents cross-run duplicates. It computes the **merge base** of all tracked
branch checkpoints in state and uses that commit as the extraction boundary for the new branch,
excluding commits already output in prior runs.

**Fallback — no common ancestor:** if the new branch shares no history with any branch in the
state (e.g. an orphan branch created with `git checkout --orphan`), gitlode cannot find a merge
base and falls back to full traversal for that branch. Duplicate commits may appear in the output
in this case. If duplicates are unacceptable, discard prior output and re-run with
snapshot mode (without `--incremental`) across all branches to re-extract cleanly, then resume incremental extraction.

For the detailed algorithm and worked examples see
[Git Traversal design](design/git-traversal.md#across-runs).

---

## Git DAG Constraints

These properties of Git's data model affect how gitlode output should be interpreted.

### Output order is not chronological

gitlode traverses the commit graph using breadth-first search (BFS). Across merge branches, BFS
order does not match commit timestamp order. **Do not rely on line order in `.jsonl` files for
chronological ordering.** Sort by `committer.timestamp` in your downstream system.

### Commits carry no branch information

A Git commit object contains no branch field. "Extracting branch X" means "walk from the commit
that ref X currently points to." The same commit OID may be reachable from multiple branches;
gitlode deduplicates by OID within each run but does not record which branch a commit was reached
through.

### Branch refs are mutable

A branch pointer moves forward with new commits. A force-push can rewrite history so that
previously recorded commits are no longer reachable from the branch. If this occurs between runs,
the recorded `lastCommitHash` in the state file may no longer be in the branch's history. gitlode
detects this and falls back to full extraction for that branch, emitting a warning to stderr.

---

## File Rotation

By default, all output goes to a single `.jsonl` file. Use rotation to split across multiple
files:

```bash
# New file every 10,000 lines
gitlode -r main --rotate-lines 10000 ./my-repo

# New file every 500 MiB
gitlode -r main --rotate-size 500M ./my-repo

# Both — rotation triggers on whichever threshold is reached first
gitlode -r main --rotate-lines 10000 --rotate-size 1G ./my-repo
```

`--rotate-size` accepts either a raw byte integer (for backward compatibility) or an integer
with suffix `K`, `M`, or `G` (case-insensitive, binary base). Valid range is `1M` to `64G`
inclusive.

Output files are named `<prefix>-<timestamp>-000001.jsonl`, `<prefix>-<timestamp>-000002.jsonl`, etc. The prefix is
derived from the repository's remote origin URL (last path segment, `.git` stripped). Use
`--output-prefix` to override. The timestamp segment (`YYYYMMDDTHHmmssZ`) is captured once per
session; all files from a single run share the same timestamp and will not overwrite files from
earlier runs.

| `--repo-name <string>`     |       | string  | —       | Override `repository.name` in all output records. Does not affect state-file identity or incremental behavior.                                                                |
| `--repo-url <string>`      |       | string  | —       | Override `repository.url` in all output records. Does not affect state-file identity or incremental behavior.                                                                 |

### Control

| Parameter   | Alias | Type    | Default | Description                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ----- | ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--quiet`   | `-q`  | boolean | `false` | Suppress progress, summary, and profile output on stderr. Warnings and errors remain visible.        |
| `--profile` |       | boolean | `false` | Print per-stage timing information to stderr after a successful extraction. Suppressed by `--quiet`. |

### Configuration File

| Parameter         | Alias | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--config <path>` | `-c`  | string | —       | Path to the gitlode configuration file. Provides defaults for refs/range/output/repository/profile and optional plugin enrichment. |

The config file is explicit opt-in: gitlode reads it only when `--config` is passed.

Supported top-level sections in `version: 1`:

- `extraction`
- `output`
- `repository`
- `runtime`
- `extensions`

Precedence rules:

- `--ref` replaces `extraction.refs` (no merge)
- `--since-ref` / `--since-date` replace `extraction.range`
- Scalar/path defaults use `CLI explicit > config > built-in`
- `--rotate-lines` and `--rotate-size` override their own thresholds independently
- effective profile is `--profile OR runtime.profile`

Conflict rule:

- `extraction.range` in config cannot be used with `--incremental`.

### Profiling output

When `--profile` is set and the run succeeds, gitlode appends an aligned block to stderr after the
default completion summary:

```
Profile
  elapsed                      : wall=  18.40ms  work=  18.40ms
  elapsed/planning             : wall=   1.10ms  work=   1.10ms
  elapsed/traversal            : wall=   8.25ms  work=   8.25ms
  elapsed/projection           : wall=   3.75ms  work=   3.75ms
  elapsed/write                : wall=   2.10ms  work=   2.10ms
  elapsed/git/blob-read        : wall=   0.80ms  work=   0.80ms
  elapsed/git/diff             : wall=   1.45ms  work=   1.45ms
  skipped_diffs                : 12
```

Each line represents one profiling entry from the per-run profiler tree.

| Entry path                 | What it measures                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `elapsed`                  | Total extraction wall/work duration captured by the root profiler              |
| `elapsed/planning`         | Branch-planning work before traversal begins                                   |
| `elapsed/traversal`        | Commit traversal and commit-fact materialization                               |
| `elapsed/projection`       | Fact-to-output-record mapping in the active projector                          |
| `elapsed/write`            | `OutputSink.write()` and `OutputSink.close()` only                             |
| `elapsed/git/blob-read`    | Blob reads inside `IsomorphicGitAdapter.getFileChanges()`                      |
| `elapsed/git/diff`         | Diff-stat computation inside `IsomorphicGitAdapter.getFileChanges()`           |
| `elapsed/git/...` children | Additional Git-internal sub-stages such as `resolve-ref`, `walk-commits`, etc. |

`wall` shows elapsed time for that scoped profiler. `work` shows additive measured work inside the
same scope. The root `elapsed` entry is always present on successful runs. Additional stage entries
are populated when profiling is enabled.

`skipped_diffs` reports how many file-level diffs were emitted with `null` additions/deletions due
to either binary content or the `--max-diff-size` guardrail.

In commit-granularity mode (no `--per-file`), Git file-expansion sub-stages such as
`elapsed/git/blob-read` and `elapsed/git/diff` remain at `0.00ms` because `getFileChanges()` is
never called.

### Mutual exclusion rules

| Combination                               | Error                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `--since-ref` + `--since-date`            | Cannot be combined                          |
| `--since-ref` + `--incremental`           | `--since-ref` is snapshot mode only         |
| `--since-date` + `--incremental`          | `--since-date` is snapshot mode only        |
| `--missing-state` without `--incremental` | `--missing-state` requires incremental mode |
| `--incremental` without `--state`         | `--state` is required for incremental mode  |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                                            |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | Success                                            |
| `1`  | User error (invalid arguments, validation failure) |
| `2`  | Runtime error (I/O failure, unexpected Git error)  |

---

## File-Level Output Mode

By default, each output record represents one commit.

With `--per-file`, each record represents one changed **file** within a commit, with commit metadata denormalized onto every record. This enables file-granularity analytics without a join: each row is self-contained.

```bash
gitlode -r main --per-file ./my-repo
```

### Output record shape (file mode)

Every record extends the commit-mode schema with a `file` object:

```json
{
  "oid": "a1b2c3d4...",
  "subject": "Fix null pointer in auth module",
  "body": "",
  "author": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T09:00:00+09:00"
  },
  "committer": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T09:05:00+09:00"
  },
  "parents": ["parenthash1"],
  "repository": { "name": "my-repo", "url": "https://github.com/org/my-repo" },
  "file": {
    "path": "src/auth/handler.ts",
    "status": "modified",
    "additions": 5,
    "deletions": 2
  }

| Field            | Type                                 | Notes                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `file.path`      | string                               | Relative path from repository root, `/`-separated |
| `file.status`    | `"added" \| "modified" \| "deleted"` | Rename detection is not performed                 |
| `file.additions` | number \| null                       | Lines added; `null` for binary files              |
| `file.deletions` | number \| null                       | Lines deleted; `null` for binary files            |

### Behavior notes

- **Empty commits** (no changed files) produce **no output records** in file mode.
- **Merge commits** diff against the first parent only.
- **Binary files** produce `"additions": null, "deletions": null`.
- **Large text diffs**: with `--max-diff-size`, if either the before or after blob size exceeds the threshold, gitlode emits `"additions": null, "deletions": null` for that file.
- **Root commits** (no parent) treat all files as `"added"`.
- **File rotation** (`--rotate-lines`, `--rotate-size`) applies per record; a single commit's file records may span rotation boundaries.
- Progress output reflects the number of file-level records written, not the number of commits processed.

### Large-file diff guardrail

Use `--max-diff-size` to avoid line-level diff cost on very large files when running in file mode:

```bash
# Skip diff counts for files larger than 100 KiB
gitlode -r main --per-file --max-diff-size 100K ./my-repo

# Same option with plain bytes
gitlode -r main --per-file --max-diff-size 100000 ./my-repo
```

Details:

- The option is disabled by default.
- It only affects `--per-file` mode.
- Accepted values: raw bytes (`100000`) or binary suffixes `K`, `M`, `G` (for example `100K`, `1M`).
- A file is considered over threshold when either its before-blob size or after-blob size exceeds the configured value.
- Over-threshold files are still emitted as file records, but with `additions` and `deletions` set to `null`.

Suggested starting values are `100K` or `1M`, depending on repository characteristics.

## Plugin Enrichment

When `--config` is passed, gitlode loads an external configuration file that declares plugins.
Each plugin attaches custom data to output records under its own namespace key inside the
`extensions` object.

```bash
gitlode -r main --config ./gitlode.config.json ./my-repo
```

### Configuration file format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "extraction": {
    "refs": ["main"],
    "range": { "sinceRef": "v1.0" }
  },
  "output": {
    "directory": "./out",
    "prefix": "gitlode"
  },
  "repository": {
    "name": "repo-override"
  },
  "runtime": {
    "profile": true
  },
  "extensions": {
    "my-plugin": {
      "entrypoint": "./my-plugin.js",
      "config": { "threshold": 10 },
      "failurePolicy": "skip-fact"
    }
  }
}
```

| Field           | Required | Description                                                                               |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`       | ✅       | Must be `1`.                                                                              |
| `extraction`    |          | Defaults for `--ref` and snapshot range.                                                  |
| `output`        |          | Defaults for output directory/prefix and rotation thresholds.                             |
| `repository`    |          | Defaults for `--repo-name` / `--repo-url`.                                                |
| `runtime`       |          | Defaults for runtime flags (currently `profile` only).                                    |
| `extensions`    |          | Map from namespace to plugin entry. When present, must have at least one entry.           |
| `entrypoint`    | ✅       | Module path or specifier. Relative paths resolve from the config file directory.          |
| `config`        |          | Passed to the plugin factory. Any JSON value.                                             |
| `failurePolicy` |          | `"skip-fact"` (default) or `"fatal"`. Controls behavior when the plugin errors on a fact. |

For complete schema and precedence details, see [Configuration File Design](design/configuration.md).

### Plugin output in records

Each output record gains an `extensions` object with one key per plugin:

```json
{
  "oid": "a1b2c3d4...",
  "subject": "Add caching layer",
  "extensions": {
    "my-plugin": { "score": 88 },
    "label-plugin": "v1.0",
    "flag-plugin": true,
    "other-plugin": null
  }
}
```

A non-null value is whatever the plugin returned as `success.data`: a plain object, a string, a
number, or a boolean. A value of `null` means the plugin skipped that fact.

### Plugin failure policies

| Policy      | Behavior on error                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `skip-fact` | Namespace is set to `null`; a warning is printed to stderr; extraction continues. |
| `fatal`     | The run aborts immediately with an error message.                                 |

### Writing a plugin

A plugin module must export a default factory function:

```javascript
// my-plugin.js
export default async function factory(config) {
  return {
    async init() {
      // Optional: validate config, open connections, etc.
      return { type: "ready" };
    },

    async project({ fact, baseRecord }) {
      if (fact.type !== "commit") {
        return { type: "skip", message: "file-change facts not supported" };
      }
      return { type: "success", data: { score: computeScore(fact) } };
    },
  };
}
```

For the full plugin contract specification, see [Plugin System Design](design/plugins.md).

### Installing a plugin package

Install the plugin as a regular npm dependency in the repository where you run gitlode:

```bash
npm install @gitlode/plugin-conventional-commits
```

Then reference the package name in your config:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "extensions": {
    "conventional-commits": {
      "entrypoint": "@gitlode/plugin-conventional-commits"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Compatibility warnings

When gitlode starts, it compares the running core version against the
`peerDependencies.gitlode` range declared in each plugin's `package.json`.
If the running version is outside the declared range, a warning is printed
to stderr before extraction begins:

```
Plugin "conventional-commits" declares peer gitlode ^0.6.0, but running gitlode is 0.7.0. Continuing; behavior may be incompatible.
```

If a plugin does not declare `peerDependencies.gitlode`, a different warning is printed:

```
Plugin "conventional-commits" does not declare peerDependencies.gitlode. Compatibility unknown; continuing.
```

These warnings are always shown even when `--quiet` is passed. They do not cause a non-zero
exit code; extraction continues regardless. To resolve a mismatch, update the plugin to a
version compatible with the running gitlode core, or pin gitlode to a version within the
plugin's declared range.

For the plugin packaging rules and peer range policy, see the
[Plugin Package Policy](design/plugins.md#plugin-package-policy) section of the design docs.
