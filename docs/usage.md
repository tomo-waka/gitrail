# gitrail — User Guide

gitrail extracts Git commit history from a local repository and writes it as
[JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) (`.jsonl`) files — one commit per line — suitable for
ingestion into data warehouses, analytics platforms, or any system that consumes
newline-delimited JSON.

---

## Extraction Modes

gitrail has two extraction modes, selected with `--mode` (alias `-m`):

### Snapshot mode (default)

`--mode snapshot` extracts commits independently of any prior state. It always walks from the
current tip of the specified branch(es) back through history. No state file is consulted during
extraction.

**When to use:**

- One-time or ad-hoc extraction
- Extracting commits since a specific release tag via `--since-ref`
- Resetting or re-initializing an incremental workflow

### Incremental mode

`--mode incremental` reads a state file to determine where the previous extraction ended, then
extracts only commits added since that point.

**When to use:**

- Regularly feeding new commits into a data warehouse or analytics pipeline
- Long-running repositories where re-extracting everything on each run is costly

Incremental mode requires `--state`.

---

## Typical Workflows

### 1. One-time analysis

Extract all commits reachable from a branch:

```bash
gitrail --branch main ./my-repo
# or with shorthand aliases
gitrail -b main ./my-repo
```

Output is written to `./my-repo-000001.jsonl` (prefix derived from the remote origin URL, or the
directory name if no remote is configured).

---

### 2. Continuous incremental extraction

For pipelines that regularly load new commits into a data warehouse.

> gitrail reads only the local `.git` directory. To pick up newly pushed commits, run
> `git fetch` before each gitrail invocation. Note that `git fetch` updates **remote-tracking
> refs** (e.g. `origin/main`), not local branch refs (`main`). Use the remote-tracking ref
> name with `--branch` (e.g. `-b origin/main`) so that a plain `git fetch` is sufficient.
> Alternatively, use `git pull` to advance the local branch, or work with a **bare clone**
> where `git fetch` updates refs directly.

**Step 1 — initialize state (once):**

```bash
gitrail -m snapshot -b main -s ./gitrail-state.json ./my-repo
```

This extracts all commits and writes a state file recording the current HEAD of each branch.

**Step 2 — all subsequent runs:**

```bash
git -C ./my-repo fetch origin
gitrail -m incremental -b origin/main -s ./gitrail-state.json ./my-repo
```

Only commits added since the last run are extracted. The state file is updated on success.

**Simplified: auto-initialize with `--on-missing-state snapshot`**

If you prefer a single command that handles both the first run and all subsequent runs:

```bash
gitrail -m incremental -b main -s ./gitrail-state.json --on-missing-state snapshot ./my-repo
```

- First run (state file absent): emits a warning to stderr, performs full extraction, creates
  the state file.
- Subsequent runs: differential extraction as normal.

---

### 3. Extract commits since a release tag

Use `--since-ref` to extract only commits that appeared after a given ref — equivalent to
`git log <ref>..<branch>`:

```bash
# All commits on main that are not reachable from v1.0
gitrail -b main --since-ref v1.0 ./my-repo
```

`--since-ref` accepts a tag name, branch name, or full commit hash.

**With state recording** (for subsequent incremental runs):

```bash
gitrail -b main -b develop --since-ref v1.0 -s ./gitrail-state.json ./my-repo
```

> **Note:** The state file records each branch's current HEAD hash — not the `--since-ref`
> boundary. A subsequent incremental run picks up commits since the HEAD recorded at this run,
> not since `v1.0`. If a branch's HEAD is reachable from the since-ref (meaning zero commits
> would be output for that branch), gitrail emits a warning to stderr.

---

### 4. CI and ephemeral environments

In CI pipelines where the environment is recreated on each run, choose the approach that fits
your setup:

**Option A — stateless snapshot (simplest)**

```bash
gitrail -b main ./my-repo
```

No state file required. Suitable when the downstream system handles deduplication
(e.g. upsert by `oid`).

**Option B — incremental with persistent state**

Store the state file on a persistent volume mounted into the container:

```bash
gitrail -m incremental -b main \
  -s /mnt/state/gitrail-state.json \
  --on-missing-state snapshot \
  ./my-repo
```

`--on-missing-state snapshot` ensures the first run after a new deployment or volume recreation
succeeds without manual intervention.

---

## State File Management

### What the state file records

After a successful run, gitrail writes a JSON file at the path given by `--state`. It records the
HEAD commit hash for each processed branch at the time of extraction:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "generatedAt": "2024-06-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "repositoryPath": "/absolute/path/to/my-repo",
  "branches": [
    { "name": "main", "lastCommitHash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6..." },
    { "name": "develop", "lastCommitHash": "d4e5f6a7b8c9..." }
  ]
}
```

### Role of `--state` in each mode

| Mode          | State file read?     | State file written?                        |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `snapshot`    | No (content ignored) | Yes (created or overwritten on success)    |
| `incremental` | Yes                  | Yes (updated with current HEAD on success) |

In snapshot mode, `--state` serves only as a recording path — prior content has no effect on
extraction. This makes it safe to run `--mode snapshot` to re-initialize state without affecting
any output.

### `--on-missing-state`

Controls behavior when `--mode incremental` is used and the state file does not exist:

| Value             | Behavior                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `error` (default) | Exits with code 1. Requires manual state initialization before the first incremental run. |
| `snapshot`        | Emits a warning to stderr, performs full extraction, and creates the state file.          |

### State file location

gitrail does not infer a default path. Specify `--state <path>` explicitly and choose a location
that persists across runs.

---

## Multi-Branch Extraction

Specify `--branch` (or `-b`) multiple times to extract from several branches in one run:

```bash
gitrail -b main -b develop -b release/1.x ./my-repo
```

**Deduplication:** commits shared between branches are written exactly once. gitrail maintains a
visited hash set across all branches within a single run.

**Output order:** all commits from the first branch are written before the second branch begins,
in the order `--branch` arguments were given.

### Adding a new branch to an existing incremental workflow

If a branch is listed in `--branch` but has no entry in the state file, gitrail performs a full
traversal for that branch. If it shares history with already-extracted branches, duplicate commits
may appear in the output.

**Recovery:** if duplicates are unacceptable, discard prior output and re-run with
`--mode snapshot` across all branches together to re-extract cleanly, then resume incremental
extraction.

---

## Git DAG Constraints

These properties of Git's data model affect how gitrail output should be interpreted.

### Output order is not chronological

gitrail traverses the commit graph using breadth-first search (BFS). Across merge branches, BFS
order does not match commit timestamp order. **Do not rely on line order in `.jsonl` files for
chronological ordering.** Sort by `committer.timestamp` in your downstream system.

### Commits carry no branch information

A Git commit object contains no branch field. "Extracting branch X" means "walk from the commit
that ref X currently points to." The same commit hash may be reachable from multiple branches;
gitrail deduplicates by hash within each run but does not record which branch a commit was reached
through.

### Branch refs are mutable

A branch pointer moves forward with new commits. A force-push can rewrite history so that
previously recorded commits are no longer reachable from the branch. If this occurs between runs,
the recorded `lastCommitHash` in the state file may no longer be in the branch's history. gitrail
detects this and falls back to full extraction for that branch, emitting a warning to stderr.

---

## File Rotation

By default, all output goes to a single `.jsonl` file. Use rotation to split across multiple
files:

```bash
# New file every 10,000 lines
gitrail -b main --rotate-lines 10000 ./my-repo

# New file every 100 MB
gitrail -b main --rotate-size 104857600 ./my-repo

# Both — rotation triggers on whichever threshold is reached first
gitrail -b main --rotate-lines 10000 --rotate-size 104857600 ./my-repo
```

Output files are named `<prefix>-<timestamp>-000001.jsonl`, `<prefix>-<timestamp>-000002.jsonl`, etc. The prefix is
derived from the repository's remote origin URL (last path segment, `.git` stripped). Use
`--output-prefix` to override. The timestamp segment (`YYYYMMDDTHHmmssZ`) is captured once per
session; all files from a single run share the same timestamp and will not overwrite files from
earlier runs.
